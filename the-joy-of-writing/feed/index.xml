I just saw this, but I am so glad it helped! I&#039;ve gone more than a year myself between writing for the same reasons as you. It&#039;s tortuous, but you&#039;ll find your way back when the time is right. Solidarity, friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the encouragement. I am in the middle of a &quot;hiatus&quot;....going on two years. Oh, I am still working, proofing and re-writing the first half of a novel I started five years ago and compiling a collection of short stories but to me this is not writing, but editing and part of publishing. I always feel the door is just about to pop open though...but as usual I find some excuse: My computer isn&#039;t right, (my old ThinkPad died and I loved the keyboard) my desk is a mess; I have too much day job stress, no free time. Yet despite my efforts otherwise I know eventually the door will open and I will find myself lost in another story...

Your article helped remind me of that....thanks.]]></description>
