You&#039;re missing the point of this post, and the entire column. The author isn&#039;t &quot;complaining&quot; but rather pointing out how women characters are often killed off to further the plot of men, in this case Padme&#039;s death for the creation of Vader. She had so much potential and there were other things she could have done but instead it was all thrown away and she was killed off. As the author pointed out, even if she did have to die they could have made it more interesting instead of just having her die from a &quot;broken heart&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who loved Padme, I&#039;m saying you shouldn&#039;t complain so much about her arc, this was the story of how Anakin became Vader. Besides I felt for Padme so much in the film, Natalie&#039;s acting was amazing to me and almost brought tears to my eyes and almost filled my black heart with uncontrollable emotion. Padne had to die suddenly to create Vader. Plus, she was the definition of Hope and her last words created a light of hope in the darkness in Revenge of the Sith]]></description>
