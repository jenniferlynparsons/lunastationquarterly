					<description><![CDATA[Insightful. I write magical realism, but am often force to market it as urban fantasy. And because my characters are realistic from various walks of life — a high school jock, a union iron worker, a professional musician, a janitor, a bartender, a high school teacher, etc. — I get the inevitable comparison to Stephen King. But my idea is to sniff around how Americans mistreat the underclass, and have since the 80’s. So my demons are all some form of “Free Market” sociopath. And how those demons prey on people’s frailty,

Like you point out, genre’s a gray area, but the difference between magial realism and urban fantasy is there if you read enough.

FYI. Gabriel García Márquez won the Nobel Prize for literature, not the book ‘100 Years of Solitude.’ The Nobel is not like the National Book Award, rewarding an extraordinary work, but instead rewards an author’s entire body of work. Which includes the excellent ‘100 Years of Solitude.’

					<description><![CDATA[If a fundamental distinction can be made I think it would be that in magical realism the setting is a mundane, realistic environment where the supernatural isn&#039;t supposed to be plausible but the author pretends there is no contradiction (the characters might act as though nothing is at odds with the rules of their universe) and the supernatural is never explained or even explicitly addressed whereas in fantasy (urban fantasy or high fantasy) the supernatural or fantastic is explicitly acknowledged and not at odds with the rules of that universe (even if the characters are discovering it for the first time in urban fantasy). I haven&#039;t really thought about it, I wouldn&#039;t necessarily stand by that opinion but that&#039;s what immediately makes sense to me, if I were to make a fundamental distinction.

As a side point, I cannot stand delusional literary elitism and it&#039;s arbitrary, subjective concept of objectively good art that has nothing to do with what people directly enjoy or are ultimately made happier by.]]></description>
