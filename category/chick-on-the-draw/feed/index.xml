					<description><![CDATA[It is with sadness that I must report I&#8217;m leaving this post at Luna Station&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is with sadness that I must report I&#8217;m leaving this post at <em>Luna Station Quarterly</em>. I&#8217;m taking on new commitments and I must reconfigure the old ones.</p>
<p>In August 2013, LSQ became the first market to publish a work of my fiction &#8211; the short story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/shaka-bars/">Shaka Bars</a>.&#8221; This much-needed acceptance gave me the confidence to aggressively pursue <a href="http://www.toryhoke.com/publications/">publication of both my short fiction and art</a>, so that I&#8217;m now Art Director for <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/"><i>Strange Horizons</i></a> and am launching <i><a href="http://www.sub-q.com/">sub-Q</a></i>, a magazine for interactive fiction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a treat and an education to watch LSQ grow. I&#8217;ve been impressed every step with Jennifer Parsons&#8217;s vision, tenacity, and cat-herding skills. Big things are already happening with LSQ, and it&#8217;s clear things will only get bigger.</p>
<p>As a parting gift, I&#8217;d like to leave you with everything I know about how to get published (it isn&#8217;t much, so it won&#8217;t take long):</p>
<h3>1. Get a Job in Technology</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.samanthagay.com/#!The-Secret-to-Life-is-Programming-advice-by-Tory-Hoke/c1s4l/2440BC3B-D106-4CF5-A139-CBEAAC070321">I can&#8217;t stress this enough.</a> I&#8217;ve had real jobs. Real jobs are hard. Avoid when possible.</p>
<h3>2. Study, Practice, and Workshop</h3>
<p>You think you know Strunk &amp; White? I did, too. But I actually forgot everything. Anything I don&#8217;t use in a past week, my brain gets rid of so it can have room for survival skills. If you want to keep style in your brain, you must trick your brain by studying&#8230; a lot.</p>
<p>Put your work in front of other people. I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.scribophile.com/">Scribophile </a>&#8211; which offers most basic features for free. Posting, critiquing, and joining a couple of groups there improved my writing and connected me to a world of other writers. More than any other one thing, workshopping transformed my writing.</p>
<h3>3. Heed Advice</h3>
<p>Best book on storytelling I ever read? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Showmanship-Handbook-Conjurers-Dover/dp/0486410870/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430169003&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=magic+and+showmanship"><i>Magic and Showmanship</i></a> by Henning Nelms. Yes, it&#8217;s dated and has lots of opinions about magician&#8217;s assistants&#8217; legs. But it&#8217;s packed with good advice, including, and I paraphrase: put your work in front of several people. They may give you different and even wrong advice. But if they keep pointing to the same moment in your performance, then you know something in that moment&#8217;s not right.</p>
<p>Get criticism that makes you mad. Walk around the block. Use it. (Learn from it how to <i>give</i> better criticism.)</p>
<h3>4. Be Happy With a B+</h3>
<p>You can make yourself crazy trying to get something perfect. Let go of perfect. Write it, workshop it, rewrite it, submit it. If reworking something is draining your enthusiasm, set it aside.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/Default.aspx">The (Submission) Grinder</a> for finding markets. <a href="https://duotrope.com/">Duotrope</a> is cool, too, but it&#8217;s pay-to-play, and IMO there&#8217;s no cause to pay money until you&#8217;re making money.</p>
<h3>5. Kill Deadlines On Sight</h3>
<p>Know how long it takes you to do a thing, and set your schedule so you can do that thing by the deadline. Account for small life surprises and occasional binges of <i>Dragon Age</i>.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t give a full response to an email right away, ping back quickly to let the sender know you got it, you&#8217;re thinking about it, and (ideally) when they can expect a full response.</p>
<p>If you feel a deadline is going to pass you by, warn your client as soon as you can. Give everybody a chance to make accommodations.</p>
<h3>6. If You Can&#8217;t Stand Rejection, Get More of It</h3>
<p>There really does come a numbness once you&#8217;ve been punched in the face enough.</p>
<p>Some kind of mental pathology really helps here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Keep up the good work, and I hope to see you out in the world someday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You work hard. You show kindness. You pay your taxes. You just remembered you have to pay your taxes. You deserve to meet three animators that will explode your brain. There are no fluffy 3D clouds or meet-cute plots here. But there are unforgettable images and squealing rapture.</p>
<p>Time Consumption Advisory: these artists&#8217; work is often short, but extremely addictive, and you may find yourself unable to do the thing you were supposed to do today.</p>
<h2>1. Nina Paley</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nina_Paley">Wikipedia</a> | <a href="http://blog.ninapaley.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ninapaley">Twitter</a></p>

<p>A cartoonist, animator, writer, and free culture (<a href="http://blog.ninapaley.com/2010/04/07/copying-is-not-theft-best/">&#8220;Copying is Not Theft&#8221;</a>) activist, Nina Paley is prolific, innovative, and engaging.</p>
<p>When Nina&#8217;s gorgeous, hilarious, wrenching magnum opus SITA SINGS THE BLUES reached NetFlix, I watched it. Enjoyed it. The next night, came home to find my roommate had just started it. Thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just sit and watch this part.&#8221; Watched the whole thing over again. It&#8217;s that good.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06Melt_2.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4132" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06Melt_2-300x169.png" alt="Nina Paley Seder Masochism" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>

<h2>2. Felix Colgrave</h2>
<p><a href="http://felixcolgrave.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/FelixColgrave">Twitter</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/elephants-garden-felix-colgrave.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4123" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/elephants-garden-felix-colgrave-300x165.png" alt="elephants-garden-felix-colgrave" width="300" height="165" /></a></p>
<p>Distinctive, playful, unsettling, Felix Colgrave&#8217;s work is so good it makes me angry. Every time he puts out a new short, I watch it three times in a row. Can&#8217;t help it.</p>
<p>He has the skill, the portfolio, and the beard-growing prowess of a man twice his age. He&#8217;s 22 right now and I can&#8217;t handle that information at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Felix-Colgrave-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4129" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Felix-Colgrave-5-300x150.jpg" alt="Felix Colgrave Fever the Ghost" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><b>Origin story</b></p>
<p>Originally from the Tasmanian Northwest, currently living and working in Melbourne, Australia, Felix produces steady freelance work, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHFFeQ2tu4">a music video for Fever the Ghost</a> and <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/l29l6p/triptank-water-into-wine">a short for Comedy Central&#8217;s Triptank</a> (NSFWish). He is also pretty great at life drawing.</p>
<p><b>Secret superpowers</b></p>
<p>Adobe Flash, comic contrast, comic timing, making Melbourne as cool as Adelaide</p>

<p>Cyriak Harris&#8217;s appetite-suppressing, electronica-backed flights of fancy are as fun as they are disturbing. There is no creature so innocuous that he can&#8217;t turn it into a hypnotic dancing spider-beast.</p>

<p><b>Origin story</b></p>
<p>Breakout star of British media site <a href="http://b3ta.com/">B3ta</a>, Cyriak answers the cries of a hungry public with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_0yuWbh8mw&amp;feature=youtu.be">music videos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlFpjJVzlGk">Adult Swim bumpers</a>, and assorted original shorts.</p>
<p><b>Secret superpowers</b></p>
<p>After Effects, music composition, patience for render times</p>

<p>Enjoy, and don&#8217;t forget your taxes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year&#8217;s animated lineup is out of control. There is no controlling it. Don&#8217;t try.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s animated lineup is out of control. There is no controlling it. Don&#8217;t try. You will hurt yourself. There are two Disney/Pixar movies coming out this year: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/?ref_=nv_sr_1">INSIDE OUT</a> (June 19) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979388/?ref_=nv_sr_1">THE GOOD DINOSAUR</a> (Nov 25). TWO PIXAR MOVIES IN ONE YEAR.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still time to find a paper bag to breathe into. Let&#8217;s talk about spring.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2224026/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">HOME</a> (March 27)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqZf8LiWvM">Official Trailer</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-dreamworks-2015.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3907" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-dreamworks-2015-300x162.jpg" alt="Home Dreamworks 2015 Animation Spring Preview" width="300" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>Based on Adam Rex&#8217;s extremely silly 2007 children&#8217;s book, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_True_Meaning_of_Smekday">The True Meaning of Smekday</a></span>, the film follows a girl and a friendly, outcast alien on the journey to find her mother and save the earth. In the book, the friendly alien was named J. Lo; those missing the old name may be relieved by the movie&#8217;s actual Jennifer Lopez.</p>
<p>And can we talk about a brown girl main character? IS THIS REAL LIFE?</p>
<p>Expect silliness, flying cars, heartfelt moments, Minions-esque marketability, and Jim Parsons at 100% Parson.<em> [ed. Nope, LSQ&#8217;s editor in chief is no relation. :)]</em></p>

<p>The release date for the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2865120/?ref_=nv_sr_1">RATCHET &amp; CLANK</a> movie remains unannounced. So if you need a throwback Sony fix, you need to dust off the PlayStation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Think IF might be fun, but don&#8217;t know where to start? Here&#8217;s how to get&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think IF might be fun, but don&#8217;t know where to start? Here&#8217;s how to get hooked in ten minutes.</p>
<h3>1) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkqBKdvpQZc">an introduction by Chris Klimas</a>, the founder of Twine.</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s about two minutes and will prime your brain. Anything that can be done in a web browser, you can do with Twine. ANYTHING. But we&#8217;ll begin at the beginning.</p>
<h3>2) Take a look at your Twine 2.0 home page.</h3>
<p>While Twine 1 was an app to download and install (for <a href="http://twinery.org/downloads/twine_1.4.2_win.exe">Windows</a> or <a href="http://twinery.org/downloads/twine_1.4.2_osx.zip">OSX</a>), <a href="http://twinery.org/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twine 2</a> is a web app that runs right in your browser. <a href="http://twinery.org/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open it in a new tab.</a></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s your first time there, it&#8217;ll look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-1.40.33-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-1.40.33-PM-300x180.png" alt="Intro to Twine 2.0 - splash page" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Hit the big green &#8220;+Story&#8221; button and create a new story.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_home_new_story.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3754" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_home_new_story-300x179.png" alt="twine_2_home_new_story" width="300" height="179" /></a></p>
<h3>3) Take a look at the big blue Twine 2 workspace.</h3>
<p>It should look about like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3755" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace-300x183.png" alt="twine_2_workspace" width="300" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Buttons do what you might guess. Hover over any of them, and a tooltip will explain.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_tooltip.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3753" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_tooltip-150x120.png" alt="twine_2_workspace_tooltip" width="150" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>For extra credit, click on the story title and take a look at the options.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_story_menu.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3752" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_story_menu-300x184.png" alt="twine_2_workspace_story_menu" width="300" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>We won&#8217;t use any of these right now, but it&#8217;s good to know they&#8217;re there.</p>
<h3>4) Edit the &#8220;Untitled Passage.&#8221;</h3>
<p>The little soft blue square is our first passage. In Twine, a passage is a unit of the story&#8211;kind of like a page is a unit of a book. To edit a passage, you can either double-click it OR hover over it and select the pencil icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_passage_options.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3756" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_passage_options-300x184.png" alt="twine_2_workspace_passage_options" width="300" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>The passage editor looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_edit_passage.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3757" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_edit_passage-300x176.png" alt="twine_2_edit_passage" width="300" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>There are instructions in the passage! They are true instructions. Write some text in your passage, and include a link to another passage. Links belong in double square brackets, so Twine knows they&#8217;re links.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, you can the link after a word in your story:</p>
<p><code>Go to the [[cellar]]</code></p>
<p>Or name the link something else.</p>
<p><code>[[I went to the cellar.-&gt;Spooky Place]]</code></p>
<p>You can also rename the passage, though this isn&#8217;t required.</p>
<p>Here is our gripping tale so far:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_editor_start.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3759" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_editor_start-300x84.png" alt="twine_2_passage_editor_start" width="300" height="84" /></a></p>
<h3>5) Close the passage, and see that Twine made new passages automatically.</h3>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_new_passages.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3760" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_new_passages-300x135.png" alt="twine_2_workspace_new_passages" width="300" height="135" /></a></p>
<p>Neat! You can also add a new passage by clicking the green &#8220;+Passage&#8221; button. You can delete a passage by hovering over it and clicking the &#8220;Trash&#8221; icon (or by hitting the good old &#8220;Delete&#8221; key.)</p>
<p>For fun, I&#8217;m going to edit the &#8220;prince&#8221; and &#8220;heel&#8221; passages, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_passages_updated.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3761" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_workspace_passages_updated-300x141.png" alt="twine_2_workspace_passages_updated" width="300" height="141" /></a></p>
<h3>6) &#8220;Play&#8221; what you&#8217;ve got so far.</h3>
<p>Hit the &#8220;Play&#8221; button. The story will build and open in a new tab.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_story_built.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3762" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_story_built-300x82.png" alt="twine_2_story_built" width="300" height="82" /></a></p>
<p>Click on a link and see where it goes!</p>
<h3>7) Set a variable.</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a &#8220;trust&#8221; variable and change it depending on the reader&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;prince&#8221; passage, add this line of code:</p>
<p><code>(set: $trust to 10)</code></p>
<p>In the &#8220;heel&#8221; passage, add this line of code:</p>
<p><code>(set: $trust to 0)</code></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter where the line of code is within the passage. It will be run when the passage is displayed.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_editor_variable.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3763" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_editor_variable-300x77.png" alt="twine_2_passage_editor_variable" width="300" height="77" /></a></p>
<p>(It&#8217;s maybe good practice to set the variable to some default starting value at the beginning, and then update it as you go, but let&#8217;s not worry about that right now.)</p>
<h3>8) Use that variable.</h3>
<p>That &#8220;trust&#8221; variable should have an impact on our story. Let&#8217;s add a passage that uses it.</p>
<p>Add this link to both the &#8220;prince&#8221; and &#8220;heel&#8221; passages:</p>
<p><code>To think I wouldn't have met him if it weren't for Lord Coddish's [[funeral]].</code></p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_prince.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3765" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_prince-300x102.png" alt="twine_2_passage_prince" width="300" height="102" /></a></p>
<p>And add this to a new &#8220;funeral&#8221; passage:</p>
<p><code>Reynaldo sat next to me during the service and I was sure</code><br />
<code>(if: $trust &gt; 0)[I'd never met a man so dignified](else:)[he'd make off with my handbag].</code></p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_funeral.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3766" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_passage_funeral-300x70.png" alt="twine_2_passage_funeral" width="300" height="70" /></a></p>
<h3>9) Hit &#8220;Play&#8221; again.</h3>
<p>The story will rebuild in the same tab as before.</p>
<p>Now, if you choose &#8220;heel,&#8221; you arrive here:</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_story_heel.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3767" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/twine_2_story_heel-300x62.png" alt="twine_2_story_heel" width="300" height="62" /></a></p>
<p>You can also hit the &#8220;Bug&#8221; button to play the story in debug mode. This gives you more information if you run into trouble.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve written a Twine story!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://twine2.neocities.org/">official full documentation is here</a>, and <a href="http://twinery.org/forum/">the forum is here</a>. There are more story formats and controls and stylesheets and anything you could want to do. WELCOME TO THE RADDEST ADVENTURE.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You may not know it when it happens, because it will sneak up on you&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may not know it when it happens, because it will sneak up on you in your browser or Kindle or mobile device. You were reading a thing, and then it gave you some kind of choice, and you clicked a link, and BAM: interactive fiction.</p>
<p>There may have been picture. There may have been sound. But mostly there was story that you, the reader, took a role in telling.</p>
<p>It may have already happened. You may have played some <a href="http://professorlayton.nintendo.com/">Professor Layton</a> or <a href="http://www.capcom.com/phoenixwright/">Phoenix Wright</a>&#8230; or <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/bgIfQaxMCMX477bn4M1BN2Ve-q-As4DQ">both</a>. You may have already read Michael Lutz&#8217;s <a href="http://correlatedcontents.com/misc/Father.html">My Father&#8217;s Long, Long Legs</a> or Lydia Neon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lifeinneon.com/games/reset.html">Reset</a>. You may have picked up <a href="http://www.dragonage.com/#!/en_US/characters">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> because Solasmance was all over your Tumblr.</p>
<p>You may be way ahead of me. You may be signed up for <a href="http://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare 32</a> and <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/east_2015/">IndieCade East</a> and taking code binge breaks to check for updates from <a href="http://aliendovecote.com/">Porpentine</a> and <a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/">anna anthropy</a>.</p>
<p>Wherever you&#8217;re at or want to be, the party is ready for you.</p>
<p>What is interactive fiction? Is it a game? Is it a story? Is it the democratized, digital reincarnation of Edward Packard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> novels?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and yes, and it&#8217;s poised to explode this year.</p>
<h3>The Demand is Massive</h3>
<p>Want a main character with the gender, color, or other character traits that interest you? IF lets you choose.</p>
<p>Enjoy cities named Rha&#8217;athal? Can&#8217;t stand cities named Rha&#8217;athal? IF lets you name.</p>
<p>Prefer metric over US customary? Prefer US customary over metric? IF lets you decide.</p>
<p>Want to participate in the characters&#8217; problem-solving? IF lets you solve the mysteries.</p>
<p>Want the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Princess Bride</span>, but with the chance to romance Inigo? IF says &#8220;viva España.&#8221;</p>
<p>Romance will be a big part of the IF boom, and women will be the driving demographic. According to the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/22-million-women-hooked-otome-romantic-dating-simulator-games-1449353">International Business Times</a> and <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/voltage-japanese-romance-simulators/">The Daily Dot</a>, 22 million women worldwide play otome apps&#8211;a dating sim for mobile devices&#8211;whose model offers the first chapter for free and the remainder for $5. BioWare&#8217;s been incorporating story, game and romance since <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Baldur%27s_Gate">1998</a>, with the combined sales of last year&#8217;s <b>Dragon Age: Inquisition</b> topping <a href="http://www.vgchartz.com/game/81793/dragon-age-inquisition/">2 million</a>.<br />
<a href="http://obscurasoft.com/">Obscurasoft</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obscurasoft/coming-out-on-top-a-gay-dating-sim-video-game">Kickstarter-funded</a> sexy, funny gay dating sim &#8220;Coming Out On Top&#8221; raised over seven times its $5000 goal and was released to <a href="http://obscurasoft.com/reviews/">critical and consumer acclaim</a>. Fiction, games, and dating sims on devices are expanding westward, and anyone can play.</p>
<h3>The Devices are Ready</h3>
<p>If you have a computer or a mobile device, you can read IF. According to the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">Pew Internet Project</a>, as of this time last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% of American adults have a smartphone, skewing strongly toward young people (83% of those age 18-29 vs. 49% of those age 50-64, moderately toward people of color (61% of Hispanic Americans, 59% African-Americans, 53% white), and slightly toward men (61% of men vs. 57% of women)</li>
<li>32% of American adults own an e-reader</li>
<li>42% of American adults own a tablet computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Downloading text-based IF takes little bandwidth, and content can easily be stored on the device for offline reading. Fiction can go everywhere the reader does.</p>
<h3>Creators Wanted</h3>
<p>Interactive fiction combines the efficiency of the written word with the showmanship of film. You can make a big impact on a smaller budget.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/empress/empress.html">With Those We Love Alive</a> by Porpentine and Brenda Neotenomie</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ice-bound.com/">Ice-Bound</a> by Aaron A. Reed and Jacob Garbe</li>
<li><a href="http://jgwaltneiv.itch.io/the-terror-aboard-the-speedwell">The Terror Aboard The Speedwell</a> by Javy Gwaltney</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re a writer, you may not think of yourself as a programmer. You may see a semicolon or curly braces and run for the hills. Fortunately we&#8217;re in a golden age of tools to turn writers into programmers. The lists below are by no means comprehensive.</p>
<p>For text-based games:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.twinery.org/">Twine</a>: Flexible and powerful. Anything you can do in a browser, you can do with Twine. Open source, gratis and libre. No central publisher, but a robust community of creators and supporters.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/">ChoiceScript</a>: Simple and streamlined. Central publisher <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/">Choice of Games</a> has interesting royalty- or commission-based payment options. Good choice for writing <b>Choose Your Own Adventure</b>-type stories for pay.</li>
<li><a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a>: Builds story environments via human-readable descriptions. I haven&#8217;t tangled with it too much, but <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/09/inform-7-update/">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> has.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.failbettergames.com/">Failbetter Games</a> is a studio that occasionally seeks contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>For picture-based games (e.g. visual novels, the Professor Layton series), there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.renpy.org/">Ren&#8217;Py</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling energized, you may even enjoy <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript</a> for making <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sokoban">Sokoban</a>-type transportation games&#8211;you know, stuff like <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rodent%27s_Revenge">Rodent&#8217;s Revenge</a> (90s PC game alongside <a href="http://ski.ihoc.net/">Ski Free</a>.) I mention PuzzleScript only because scripting with it is very, very fun.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For the past two years, between watching cartoons and doing other crazy crap, I&#8217;ve helped&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past two years, between watching cartoons and doing other crazy crap, I&#8217;ve helped moderate an online support group forum for survivors of family trauma. In that time the community has grown from fewer than a hundred members to tens of thousands. I no longer do the heavy lifting of moderation duties, but I still pinch-hit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a hell of an education.</p>
<h2>1. On the Internet, humans are meeting artificial intelligence halfway.</h2>
<p>As a species, we set the stage for AI when we started writing letters.</p>
<p>Considering that text-based communication strips away vocal inflection, facial expression, and body language&#8211;what had been for a million years our only communication mechanisms at all&#8211;it&#8217;s a miracle we can get across any idea. Considering any online forum throws together total strangers&#8211;who have complete access to their own hurt feelings and no access to anyone else&#8217;s until they exercise heroic imagination&#8211;it&#8217;s a miracle anyone can get along.</p>
<p>Those who can get along are in a much better position to make sense of our eventual digital overlords.</p>
<h2>2. If you find yourself in disagreement with someone, and you sincerely want to figure out the solution, prove it by starting with a good-faith restatement of their case (Rogerian-style negotiation.)</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen nothing soothe bruised feelings like this approach, e.g. &#8220;I hear that you think X, and you want Y.&#8221; Restating the other person&#8217;s position before describing my own has transformed me from being a &#8220;power-tripping fascist&#8221; to a reasonable human being in no more than three exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>In his 1951 paper, &#8220;Communication: Its Blocking and its Facilitation,&#8221; [therapist Carl Rogers] proposes that the empathy and feedback model could be used to facilitate communication in emotion-laden situations outside the therapeutic relationship, such as political or labor negotiations. His formula is simple: &#8220;Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker, and to that speaker&#8217;s satisfaction.&#8221; In later articles he details Rogerian-style negotiation sessions that have produced astonishing results, including the Camp David negotiations conducted by Jimmy Carter, a conference involving health care providers and impoverished and embittered health care consumers, and even opposing sides in Northern Ireland (Rogers and Ryback 1984).</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://people.ucalgary.ca/~dabrent/art/rogchap.html">Rogerian Rhetoric: An Alternative to Traditional Rhetoric, Douglas Brent, University of Calgary</a></p>
<p>I heard about this approach being used at a Bay Area tech conference debate, I think, and boy howdy does it work.</p>
<h2>3. Contrapositively, deliberately mischaracterizing someone&#8217;s position is a great way to piss them off</h2>
<p>e.g. &#8220;Oh, I get it. You&#8217;re just doing this because X.&#8221; More than name-calling, abusive language, or threats of violence, deliberately mischaracterizing someone&#8217;s position is the single most effective way to make someone fly into a rage. So 1) please don&#8217;t do this and 2) if someone does it to you, beware it is sanity Kryptonite.</p>
<h2>4. The best way to tell a normie from a troll is to push on them a little.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen malicious-looking posts from users who turned out to wish help. I&#8217;ve seen helpful-looking posts form users who turned out to wish harm. I&#8217;ve seen posts with absolutely undistinguishable intent. Fortunately all a mod has to do is say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t do that here,&#8221; and intent readily identifies itself: normies recant and trolls explode. About one in ten will be a normie who is outraged by being pushed on. That&#8217;s where lesson #2 applies.</p>
<h2>5. Like a defense attorney, a mod most defend every poster.</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>A) The person who posts is more vulnerable than the person who comments. By standing up and speaking, a poster makes themselves a target. Commenters can dogpile. Posters can&#8217;t. Thus as a mod I always side more with a poster than a commenter, occasionally to a commenter&#8217;s outrage. In these cases, lesson #2 works a treat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>B) It does more harm for an innocent individual to be falsely accused than for a guilty individual to walk free. It is vital that we take every poster seriously. If we let the community dismiss/belittle/shout down one person expressing&#8211;among other things&#8211;thoughts of suicide, then others with thoughts of suicide will be less likely to express them. That insecurity is exactly what keeps suffering people silent, and exactly what the community cannot abide.</p>
<p>Yes, this means you&#8217;ll see mods supporting and failing to remove content you despise. But the flip-side is that, when someone questions your post, the mods will defend it, too.</p>
<p>Yes, this means no matter how many people decide a poster is faking, exaggerating, or catfishing, we let the poster keep posting. There is a solution for catfish, and it has nothing to do with us mods:</p>
<h2>6. Healthy boundaries work in all cases.</h2>
<p>If you exercise loving detachment, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you believe what a person is saying or not.</p>
<p>If a stranger says they need money, healthy boundaries will keep you from sending money&#8211;or permit you to send money only if you&#8217;re completely prepared to see no advantage from it.</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s a good time to reiterate how highly I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Codependent-No-More-Controlling-Yourself/dp/0894864025/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417200256&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=codependent+no+more">Codependent No More</a>.</p>
<h2>7. Giving orders is anti-social.</h2>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re 100% sure what someone should do to solve all their problems, giving them an order (&#8220;leave him,&#8221; &#8220;get a job,&#8221; &#8220;you should stop calling her&#8221;) is not going to go over well.</p>
<p>I recommend giving life advice the same way one gives a fiction critique:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]o should; use “I” statements; phrase things in the context of what worked for you or not, without assuming the stance of every reader; talk about the story, not the author; don’t refer to other authors as any kind of example.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://denverfictionwriters.com/giving-getting-critiques/">Denver Fiction Writers</a> pretty damn good fiction critique how-to</p>
<h2>8. I am pretty OK with being called a power-tripping fascist.</h2>
<p>It helps to have other power-tripping fascists around to check in with.</p>

<p>I am white. I make drawings and stories. I get some of these published. I take up bandwidth. So, I try to make those drawings and stories reflect the people who are stuck looking at them. Continually I discover the areas in which I could be better at this, particularly when it comes to representing people of color.</p>
<p>Drawing a person of color is one thing. If a character doesn&#8217;t have solid anatomy, expression, and appeal, it&#8217;s a failure of skill, not empathy. Plus, in the cartoony style I tend toward, disbelief is suspended, character conflicts are simplified, and if my comic strip characters express no diversity in their food choices, observed holidays, language, or beliefs, I have a handy &#8220;it&#8217;s just a cartoon&#8221; blanket to hide under (despite all I&#8217;ve said about <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/4-reasons-cartoons-matter/">why cartoons matter</a>.)</p>
<p>But in writing every word matters. Every omission matters. Each character makes decisions informed by their experience, or they don&#8217;t. There are no big eyes or Dreamworks smiles to smooth rough edges. There&#8217;s no blanket.</p>
<p>This past year I went through <strong>five stages of a white person trying to write a person of color</strong>.</p>
<h3>1. Realizing diversity matters</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t suspect anyone reading this disagrees that story matters, representation matters, and humans have a deep need to see themselves reflected in their culture. But for me Kayla Ancrum&#8217;s <a href="http://mediadiversified.org/2013/12/19/how-to-write-women-of-colour-and-men-of-colour-if-you-are-white/">How to Write Women of Colour and Men of Colour if You are White</a> article on <a href="http://mediadiversified.org/">Media Diversified</a> last winter was a hell of a call to action, with a key declaration:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracters within your text will also be perceiving your POC character as Ethnic, even if they are heavily [Western Neutral]. There is NO SUCH THING as colorblindness. A great example of this is the relationship between Alai and Ender in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ender’s Game</span>. Alai and pretty much all POC characters in that book are WN as hell, but Ender (being white) is constantly commenting on their ethnicness. Not because he’s a racist child. But just because he can SEE it. Do NOT have your white characters pretending that POC aren’t POC. It will fall flat and seem heavily unrealistic. Plus there are the racist implications of <a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/10/0421online.html">“colorblindness”</a> to consider.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Realizing omission isn&#8217;t harmless</h3>
<p>BOING. Wait. So mentioning once that a character has brown skin isn&#8217;t the same as writing a PoC? Putting a PoC in a room full of white people and giving them no opinions or feelings about that is dishonest? Pretending racism doesn&#8217;t exist is actually pretty racist? OH MY GOD. But my intentions were so good!</p>
<h3>3. Realizing good intentions aren&#8217;t enough</h3>
<p>Last February I had the honor of having <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2014/20140210/Lysistrata-f.shtml">a story</a> published by <em>Strange Horizons</em>. It was a month after publication that I realized the story hinged on a marginalized secondary character throwing all her effort into supporting the publicly-acceptable main character, at great personal cost, for sort of vague &#8220;it&#8217;s the right thing to do&#8221; reasons. I&#8217;d trotted out a tired, racist trope. I&#8217;d written a Magical Negro without the tattle-tale Blackness.</p>
<p>The most galling part of this problem is that it would have been so easy to fix. If I&#8217;d explored the secondary character a little more deeply, a dozen solutions would have presented themselves. Righting an old wrong! Financial gain! Anything!</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t meet my responsibilities. I didn&#8217;t have the perspective to do what needed to be done.</p>
<p>So I took Ancrum&#8217;s advice. I subscribed to new blogs and followed new people on Twitter. I read and refrained from commenting. I did think a lot of new thoughts and realize a lot of new truths.</p>
<h3>4. Realizing research isn&#8217;t enough</h3>
<p>At some point I thought I had enough of a sense of the way a young Black woman would speak and act, what she would want, and what she would be worried about, to believe I could write a novella with a young Black woman main character. I wrote the novella. I deployed AAVE with no understanding of whether it was appropriate for the character. I deployed my jokey prose with no consideration of whether that voice was consistent with the main character&#8217;s POV. I also wrote a Black African man secondary character as a Saint Yoda. Fortunately before the work could see the light of day there spoke a still, small voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure you know what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank God for small voices.</p>
<h3>5. Finding a solution</h3>
<p>About that time, <a href="http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/im-spending-today-swapping-dialect-novel/">Mary Robinette Kowal</a> shared her experience collaborating with <a href="http://jhohadli.wordpress.com/2014/07/31/on-the-hustle-the-mary-robinette-kowal-project/">Joanne Hillhouse</a> to create the Antiguan Creole English in her latest novel. It became clear what I had to do: find another human being with the knowledge I needed, ask for her help, and compensate her for her labor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen it <a href="http://midnightbreakfast.com/writing-people-of-color">suggested</a> that white writers put their stories in front of their PoC friends to vet. This must be good advice because I see it so often from real live PoC creators. But I personally can&#8217;t imagine doing this, because</p>
<ul>
<li>1) I have precious few friendly acquaintances who are Black. I have precious few friendly acquaintances that I would subject to the request of &#8220;read this and give me notes.&#8221; There is no overlap between those two groups.</li>
<li>2) The &#8220;read this, give me notes, unpack the PoC representation issues from the general story issues, and stay my friend&#8221; favor is several orders of magnitude larger than any favor that any of these acquaintances has asked of me. That would be up there with U-Haul packing and 4:00 AM rides to the airport.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I wouldn&#8217;t ever dump a story on a friend this way. But I would put it in front of a couple of other pairs of eyeballs first.</p>
<p>But if not a friend, then who?</p>
<p>Kowal used social media to ask for help. That seems like a sound approach to me, but my social reach is not that big and, we have already established, pretty white. Fortunately there are a <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/writing-translation/proofreading-editing/#layout=auto&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lot</a> <a href="http://www.fiverup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of</a> <a href="http://gigbucks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">websites</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=fiverr%20alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that can connect</a> a writer with an editor. I used one. I found two editors that now I wouldn&#8217;t dare write without. I hope I never submit another story without putting it in front of one or both of these women. Through them I get education, sanity checks, perspective, and just damn good story notes. I&#8217;ve used workshops. Workshops are cool. These editors are better.</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting this is the necessary or right or even reasonable course of action for anyone else. But it&#8217;s working for me. If anyone else is interested in making it work for them, but doesn&#8217;t have discretionary funds, there are other ways to compensate editors for their labor. Swap work? Barter? But IMO compensation is key. I would never have the guts to ask what I ask of my editors if I couldn&#8217;t reciprocate the value of their labor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not suggesting that my writing problems are solved. If the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior, all signs point to me finding out in a month what else I&#8217;m doing ungodly wrong. When I do, I&#8217;ll let you know. But until then, I&#8217;m in a better place than I&#8217;ve ever been.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes animation is sort of like SNL in the early 90s&#8211;it assumes men dressed as women are funnier than actual women.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SNL-Gap-Girls.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2833" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SNL-Gap-Girls-300x204.png" alt="SNL Gap Girls Sketch" width="300" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying <a title="Cross-Dressing Voices" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Dressing Voices</a> is always men-as-women. Where would animated boy roles be without June Foray, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Christine Cavanaugh, E. G. Daily, Laura Torres, Tara Strong, and Cree Summer? Not every show dares to let their male kid lead grow up &#8211;as <em>Avatar: the Last Airbender</em> and <em>Adventure Time</em> did.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not saying men posing as women can&#8217;t be funny or subversive. Divine as Edna Turnblad, the <em>Kids in the Hall</em> as their lady counterparts<em>, </em>and Jordan Peele as <a title="Meegan" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eirBtt7wIDU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meegan</a> are all comedy gold. But what&#8217;s vital to their success is that the funny comes from the characters and situations, and not simply the drag itself.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not saying the male performers don&#8217;t deserve the part. Many of the cases I&#8217;m about to describe are actually male show creators who took on female roles in development and never let go. Who could say a show&#8217;s creator doesn&#8217;t know the character?</p>
<p>What fan would single out one not-entirely-satisfying drag performance in an otherwise satisfying movie or show?</p>
<p>Who could ask a show creator to give up their sweetest plum?</p>
<p>Who could suggest the character might take on a new dimension in the hands of, say, a professional female performer with decades of experience?</p>
<p>That person would have to be a bit of a nit-picky dirtbag.</p>
<p>Let this dirtbag say it: unless a man-in-drag voice performance is damn funny or damn subversive, it&#8217;s frustrating to see.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2832" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/jack_and_jill.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-2832" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/jack_and_jill-300x211.jpg" alt="Jack and Jill movie still theater laughing" width="300" height="211" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2832" class="wp-caption-text">And maybe just a bit tired.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span id="more-1955"></span></p>
<p>My frustration index is determined via the following three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the character actually funny?</li>
<li>Does the attempted funny come from character aspects, not just the drag?</li>
<li>Is the character the most significant female role in the show?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore six instances of female roles cast with male voice actors, in increasing order of frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/linda_belcher.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2839" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/linda_belcher-300x168.jpg" alt="Linda Belcher Bob's Burgers" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<h3>6. Linda (<em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers</em>) &#8211; John Roberts</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td>Yes, and wonderfully pushy, sexual, and striving</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td>Bit of ensemble, but I&#8217;d say no</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The main de-frustrating advantages of the women in <em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers</em> is that 1) they&#8217;re complete characters and 2) there&#8217;s a lot of them. They inflict as much suffering as they endure. They have flaws, ambitions, and one-liners. Linda&#8217;s voice doesn&#8217;t draw attention to itself, and John Roberts&#8217;s performance is organic and unique. What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tina_Belcher.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2840" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tina_Belcher-300x199.jpg" alt="Tina Belcher" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<h3>5. Tina (<em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers</em>) &#8211; Dan Mintz</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td>Oh, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td>Yes, and wonderfully complex and weird (&#8220;friend fiction&#8221;)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td>Debatable. I think this honor goes to the youngest, Louise, who is voiced by Kristen Schaal</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Dan Mintz&#8217;s deadpan delivery suits Tina like a seductive slow dance. It would have been interesting to hear, say, <a title="Judy Greer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczBvqSI6Z8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judy Greer</a> or <a title="Pamela Adlon" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WQGS2zGAXg#t=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Adlon</a> take on the character, but Mintz&#8217;s Tina is engaging, authentic, and funny. She doesn&#8217;t sound like a drag performance. She sounds like Tina.</p>
<p>(Also, randomly, I just realized the Belcher daughters make &#8220;Tina Louise.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lumpy_space_princess.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2841" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lumpy_space_princess-300x168.png" alt="Lumpy Space Princess Adventure Time" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Lumpy Space Princess (<em>Adventure Time</em>) &#8211; Pendleton Ward</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td>Yes, and a great character (&#8220;Oh my glob.&#8221;)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As much as I love Lumpy Space Princess (and I *love* Lumpy Space Princess) Ward&#8217;s performance has a distancing effect. While part of LSP&#8217;s charm is how off-putting, awkward, and demanding she is, a voice that brought the audience closer would have made her, like stars Finn and Jake, as heart-melting as she is funny. She&#8217;s so very nearly perfect. I mean, look at that face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Edna_Mode.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2842" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Edna_Mode-300x173.jpg" alt="Edna Mode" width="300" height="173" /></a></h3>
<h3>3. E. Mode (<em>The Incredibles)</em> &#8211; Brad Bird</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td>Yes, and a great character (&#8220;NO CAPES!&#8221;)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td>No (That&#8217;d be Mrs. Incredible, with many other female characters no slouch)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Energetic, driven, opinionated, and high-tech, Edna Mode is a fan favorite role and it would have been fantastic to hear what a professional woman voice actor brought to it. Was <a title="Linda Hunt" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yijQGEBFnJo#t=72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Hunt</a> too busy? But I can&#8217;t go griping too loud because allegedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Edna_Mode">Lily Tomlin herself told Brad Bird to keep the role</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/roz_monsters_inc.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2843" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/roz_monsters_inc-300x237.png" alt="Roz Monsters Inc" width="300" height="237" /></a></p>
<h3>2.  Roz (<em>Monster&#8217;s Inc.</em>) &#8211; Bob Peterson</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td> Probably the only unfunny part of the whole movie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td> No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td> No. Even after Boo, it&#8217;s a split decision with Celia</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The central joke of Roz is that she&#8217;s plain, deadpan, and a foil for Mike Wazowski, with all the visual setup of a Gary Larson matron and none of the punchline. At the end of the movie, it turns out she has a secret, which is something, but that braying voice puts the &#8220;oy&#8221; in &#8220;<em>why?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>And the all-time most frustrating female role cast with a male voice actor:</em></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3> <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dr_girlfriend.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2844" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dr_girlfriend-300x226.jpg" alt="Dr Girlfriend" width="300" height="226" /></a></h3>
<h3>1. The Venture Brothers (<em>Dr. Girlfriend</em>) &#8211; Doc Hammer</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Funny?</td>
<td>I guess. Doc Hammer uses a really deep voice. Plus New England accent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Funny outside of wacky voice?</td>
<td>Sometimes. Usually more reactive and straight man, so to speak, than funny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Most significant female role in the show?</td>
<td>Hands down, yes. She&#8217;s the only female series regular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bonus frustration</td>
<td>Male gaze out the yin yang</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here&#8217;s the reason that, madcap and winking and depraved as <em>The Venture Brothers</em> is, it never got on my must-see list the way madcap, winking, depraved <em>Archer</em> did. <em>Archer</em> offsets its rampant fan service with a near 50% representation of complex, bizarre, unforgettable female characters&#8211;who also all happen to be voiced by women. <em>The Venture Brothers</em> has Dr. Girlfriend.</p>
<p>In case her name doesn&#8217;t give it away, be assured she exists primarily as the voice of reason to her sometime boyfriend baddie. She also exists to pose in outfits. Her coarse, booming voice adds nothing and destroys relatability, as Monarch&#8217;s henchmen question her gender yet she herself seems unaware of how bizarre she sounds.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s smart and does science sometimes, which is nice, and if she was one of a few women among the series regulars, she wouldn&#8217;t be so frustrating. But she&#8217;s not. So she is.</p>
<p>Imagine a Dr. Girlfriend that talks like <a title="Claudia Black" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WQGS2zGAXg#t=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia Black</a> and you&#8217;ll see the chance that was missed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alison Bechdel&#8217;s famous test&#8211;one canny gag in an indie comic strip from 1985&#8211;has been embraced&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alison Bechdel&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famous test</a>&#8211;one canny gag in an indie comic strip from 1985&#8211;has been embraced by entertainment critics, theorists, and journalists as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold standard</a> for determining whether a film has, as <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2009/12/the-bechdel-test-for-women-in-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feminist Frequency</a> describes in its excellent primer, &#8220;significant female presence.&#8221; Three obvious reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s dead simple.</li>
<li>It quantifies the vague.</li>
<li>It hilariously indicts movies that can&#8217;t jump the first bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rule itself is offered by one character sick of macho &#8220;Barbarian&#8221;/&#8221;Vigilante&#8221; movie BS, and received by the other as &#8220;pretty strict, but a good idea.&#8221; At the time of its introduction, the rule was not presented as more than the preference of one woman tired of supporting an industry happy to exclude her (Bechdel&#8217;s friend, Liz Wallace.)</p>
<p>The Bechdel Test does not bother with shades of agency, complexity, or quality. It is simple. It is elegant. It is brass tacks.</p>
<p>So why do so few Hollywood movies pass it? And how can this be fixed?</p>
<p><em>(Final act spoilers ahead for movies released in 2014.)</em></p>
<h2>Hollywood Doesn&#8217;t Care About Quality</h2>
<p>Moviemaking is a business. That&#8217;s not cynicism; that&#8217;s reality. As <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005036/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1#writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gale Anne Hurd</a> put it in EW&#8217;s <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/07/17/the-terminator-oral-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8216;The Terminator&#8217; at 30: An oral history</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Success for us meant being able to make another movie. It didn’t mean box-office success or critical success—our goal was to be able to do it again. Anyone who doesn’t feel that way should not be in the business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, to paraphrase alternate-reality-game co-creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elan_Lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elan Lee</a> at <a href="https://chocovivo.com/shop/smoreside-chat-w-nolan-bushnell-elan-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent talk</a>, no one in this business cares about telling a story. They care about having their job tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hence franchises, sequels, reboots, and rip-offs. Hence seeing the thing that worked and doing it again, regardless of whether it reflects the culture, satisfies the audience, or is any good at all. (This strategy makes money: of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fifty top-grossing movies</a>, only 14 are not sequels, reboots, or later installments of an established franchise&#8211;hang in there, <i>Star Wars</i>.)</p>
<p>Hence <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-studios-success-marvel-movies-diversity/?trackback=fbshare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;if Marvel makes Thor 3 before it makes Black Panther, it will have made ten movies headlined by blond white men named Chris before it makes one movie headlined by someone who isn’t even white</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a PoC woman wants a piece of the pie, God forbid, she better polish up her katas, get painted green, or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2307054848/tt1731141?ref_=ttmi_mi_all_sf_5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mill around somberly disapproving of Harrison Ford</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone QUILTBAG wants in, that person better be prepared for sassy friendship or early <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fridging</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, of the top-grossing fifty, only five have a female lead, yet two out of the top five do&#8211;<i>Titanic</i> and <i>Frozen</i>. Come on, Hollywood, do you hate money?)</p>
<h2>In the Hero&#8217;s Journey, it&#8217;s All About the Main Character</h2>
<p>Feature-length storytelling is highly regimented. One need only consult <a href="http://www.savethecat.com/category/beat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Snyder&#8217;s beat sheet</a> to see the irrefutable rules of the three-act structure. Following the structure doesn&#8217;t mean a movie will be good, but deviating from it is an outstanding way to alienate audiences: when there&#8217;s no first-act debate, the stakes are unclear. When there&#8217;s no clear break into Act II, investment is lost. When an act runs too long, momentum is spoiled. When there&#8217;s no Act II reversal, progress is monotonous.</p>
<p>Anything out of place ends up on the cutting-room floor.</p>
<p>Thus in any movie with a single lead, it&#8217;s uncommon for two supporting characters to discuss anything BUT the lead and the lead&#8217;s needs. The best chances for two supporting characters to get a word in are Boardroom Exposition and Baddie Confides The Scheme, both abundant in the second act.</p>
<p><i>Titanic</i>, <i>Frozen</i>, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, the <i>Hunger Games</i> franchise, the <i>Twilight</i> franchise and <i>Tangled</i>, wouldn&#8217;t pass the Bechdel Test if the lead were male, even if the love-interest were gender-swapped. Elsa and Primrose never talk to their moms. Effie Trinket never warns Peeta about the mahogany. And Bella&#8211;well, nothing happens in Forks that&#8217;s not all about Bella.</p>
<p>(Tellingly, if Hans were gender-swapped instead of true love-interest Kristof, the theoretical-male-lead-Bechdel would be passed when Baddie Confides The Scheme to Elsa.)</p>
<p>So audiences are doomed? No.</p>
<h2>How to Make a Hero&#8217;s Journey Pass the Bechdel Test</h2>
<h3>Cast the Lead as Female, Plus Any Other Named Character She Interacts With</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s how <i>Alien</i> <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/zizyphus/34585797/lightbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed muster</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)#Casting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deliberately unisex writing and ground-breaking casting</a>. A female lead is great, but it&#8217;s not enough to get over <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Smurfette Principle</a>.</p>
<p>The other female character can be anything: spooky kid, sassy granny, brain surgeon, wicked queen, Lance Corporal, Supreme Court Justice. She can even be a romantic rival (ugh) so long as she has another hobby&#8211;knitting, Krav Maga, anything&#8211;relevant enough to the lead to make the final cut.</p>
<h3>Cast Half of the Supporting Roles as Female</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not so crazy. Women are just <i>everywhere</i> nowadays&#8211;Congress, Afghanistan, Asgard. There&#8217;s plenty of flavor and exposition two women could share, if there were just enough of them running around. Come on, James Cameron, Kenneth Branagh, and Tim Gunn&#8211;when your unisex space army goes and fights another unisex space army, it just seems a little&#8230; mundane.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t stand the thought of ladies getting 50% of the exosuits, may I suggest my personal favorite&#8230;</p>
<h3>Cast the Antagonist as Female</h3>
<p>Who in a story definitively has a goal apart from the hero&#8217;s? Who gets abundant screen time and great lines? The antagonist, that&#8217;s who. There is no movie that can&#8217;t be improved by a showdown with Sigourney Weaver.</p>
<p>Afraid a female baddie can&#8217;t hold her own physically in the final fight? Or that audiences will rightly squirm to see the hero sock her in the face? Good news&#8211;of the current ten top-grossing movies of 2014 (plus <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, which may yet make it), half those final fights used only strategy, talking it out, and/or superhuman force. All of those could have cast a woman as the antagonist with no further complications.</p>

<p>*Interesting that Mystique does most of the kick-punching in <i>X-Men: DOFP</i>, and her superpower is not combat-related.</p>
<p>(Thanks to the <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bechdel Test Movie List</a> for many verifications.)</p>
<p>Afraid the general male-goodie, female-baddie scenario will read as sexist? No problem. Consider the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096446/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Willow</a> solution&#8211;cast a woman as the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentor</a>. She and the baddie will have plenty to talk about while they&#8217;re fighting to the death.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t stomach a female baddie at all? A female henchman can provide an excellent character arc, with third act death (<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, at least apparently) or reconciliation (<i>Rio 2</i>, <i>Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2.</i>)</p>
<p>Yes, many of these established the antagonist as male in source material. Therefore I extend this proposal to source material.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no need for Hollywood to risk its neck for more female presence. It just needs to swap some pronouns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe you&#8217;re out of the cartoon loop. Maybe you don&#8217;t have cable TV. Maybe you&#8217;re&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you&#8217;re out of the cartoon loop. Maybe you don&#8217;t have cable TV. Maybe you&#8217;re a former fan who got super distracted by <i>Breaking Bad</i>. Well, there&#8217;s been no better time to reconnect. We live in a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/netflix-house-of-cards-and-the-golden-age-of-television/272869/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">golden age of television</a>, and animation is no exception&#8211;plus shows are passing the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mako Mori Test</a> left and right (in most episodes, at least one female character has her own narrative arc distinct from any male characters&#8217; arcs.)</p>
<p>If you have the time, these shows are ready to tickle your nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>Here we go, in no particular order:</p>
<h2>1. Gravity Falls (TV-G)</h2>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gravity_falls.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1958" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gravity_falls-300x168.png" alt="Gravity_Falls_Tourist_Trapped" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Creator:</strong> Alex Hirsch. Worked on <i>The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack</i> alongside Pendleton Ward (<i>Adventure Time</i>) and J.G. Quintel (<i>Regular Show</i>)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Builds a continuity. Funny on many levels. Based loosely on show creator&#8217;s real-life upbringing, twin sister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Hirsch#Personal_life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twin sister&#8217;s desire for pig</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Show creator&#8217;s age (28) may cause feelings of inadequacy. Also, show is on the air when kids are at school? I don&#8217;t understand modern TV schedules.</p>
<p><strong>How it passes:</strong> Dipper (Jason Ritter) may be the show&#8217;s star, but his boy-crazy, bossy (in a good way) twin sister Mabel (Kristen Schaal) follows her own dreams&#8211;whether it&#8217;s winning a pig or, you know, surviving attack by candy monster.</p>
<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Disney XD, weekdays 11 AM EST</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Episode (if you like this, you&#8217;ll like the rest):</strong> &#8220;Tourist Trapped&#8221; Season 1 Episode 1. In most <i>Gravity Falls</i> episodes, it&#8217;s clever Dipper or even bumbling Soos that defeats the baddie. In others, the story resolution is &#8220;Mabel feels bad for being so bossy.&#8221; Fortunately, the series pilot gives a taste of capable Mabel: cornered by murderous gnomes, Mabel pushes past her brother&#8217;s objections to execute her own plan and save the day.</p>
<h2>2. Archer (TV-MA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/archer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1959" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/archer-300x174.jpg" alt="Archer Wind Cries Mary Lana Cyril" width="300" height="174" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Creator:</strong> Adam Reed (<i>Sealab 2021</i>, <i>Frisky Dingo</i>)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Highest joke-per-minute ratio. Impossible to read dialogue without hearing character voices. Female characters are abundant, differentiated, and as horny/unsavory/incompetent as the male ones.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Unabashed, one-sided sexploitation. Fat-shaming. Ants. Let&#8217;s reaffirm that just because a show passes the Mako Mori Test doesn&#8217;t make it feminist.</p>
<p><strong>How it passes:</strong> Stay with me. Yes, Lana (who is Black) and Pam (who is fat) are subjected to having their clothes removed with a frequency no other series regulars are, and that deserves to be unpacked. At the same time, the four female main characters, all assertive sexual beings, represent a range of age and body type utterly absent from any other series&#8211;animated or&#8230; well, I&#8217;d say live-action, but I don&#8217;t watch a lot of live-action. Is there a lot of lady diversity on <i>The Good Wife</i>? Anyway, Lana (Aisha Tyler) dreams of starting her own agency, Pam (Amber Nash) taunts and kills her own kidnappers, and Malory (Jessica Walter) runs the agency and her adult child with a dash of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. And Cheryl (Judy Greer)? She&#8217;s one in an LSD-gummy-bear-eating billion.</p>
<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> FX, Thursdays at 10 PM EST; Hulu; Netflix (through Season 4)</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Episode:</strong> &#8220;The Wind Cries Mary&#8221; Season 4 Episode 2. When Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) reignites a bromance, ISIS sends Cyril (Chris Parnell) and Lana to extract him. Lana exhibits ingenuity, endurance, and abundant one-liners, albeit poor marksmanship. No one said she was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Voted most likely to</strong> spatter blood.</p>
<h2>3. Adventure Time (TV-PG)</h2>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Adventure_Time_Sky_Witch.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1960" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Adventure_Time_Sky_Witch-300x165.png" alt="Adventure Time Sky Witch" width="300" height="165" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Creator:</strong> Pendleton Ward</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Gorgeous retro title cards. Pretty even male-female cast split. Sprawling continuity. Startling story twists. Feels.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not enough Lumpy Space Princess, IMO.</p>
<p><strong>How it passes:</strong> Gender-swap episodes not needed&#8211;Princess Bubblegum is a wonder of princess-trope-puncturing. She solves mysteries, punches baddies, and doesn&#8217;t always have the best attitude about it.</p>
<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Cartoon Network basically all the time (Weekdays 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM, 5:00 PM, 5:30, 7:00 PM EST, Weekends even more); Netflix (seasons 1&amp;2)</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Episode:</strong> There are emotions aplenty in Season 5&#8217;s &#8220;Simon and Marcy,&#8221; but you&#8217;ll need traction on the show (Ice King who? Marceline what?) to feel them. For goofy, encapsulated, lady-dense madness, try &#8220;Sky Witch,&#8221; Season 5 Episode 29, where pushy vampire Marceline (Olivia Olson) enlists smug Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch) to retrieve a sentimental object. There&#8217;s lots of pink, but it&#8217;s not always pretty. Miyazaki would high-five.</p>
<p><strong>Voted most likely to</strong> produce <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/kmallikarjuna/15-pieces-of-writing-advice-from-the-writers-of-adventure-ti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new rules of writing</a> and <a href="http://screenrobot.com/adventure-times-offspring-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative descendants</a>.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>4. Bob&#8217;s Burgers (TV-PG)</h2>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bobs_burgers_spaghetti_western_and_meatballs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1961" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bobs_burgers_spaghetti_western_and_meatballs-300x168.jpg" alt="Bob's Burgers Spaghetti Western and Meatballs" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Creator:</strong> Loren Bouchard</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast, weird, charming. Rampant puns. Every character gets a spin on the plot-go-round.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Linda (mother) and Tina (older daughter) Belcher are voiced by men (John Roberts and Dan Mintz, respectively.) Don&#8217;t get me wrong, they actors do great work, and it&#8217;s impossible to imagine the characters any other way, but it&#8217;s a bit of a throwback to a men-as-women-are-funnier-than-women-as-women era.</p>
<p><strong>How it passes:</strong> Social-climbing, pushy-but-loving Linda is no long-suffering Marge Simpson or Lois Griffin&#8211;she has her own schemes and suffers her own consequences. Young Louise (Kristen Schaal AGAIN) is an adorable holy terror and slap-happy taskmaster, to other kids as well as her own family. Even the most inert member of the cast&#8211;creative, horny, and creatively horny Tina&#8211;has and pursues her own desires, which unlike many animated teen TV daughters aren&#8217;t just to snark and be snarked at.</p>
<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Fox, Sundays at 7:00 PM EST; Netflix (through Season 3); Hulu</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Episode:</strong> &#8220;Spaghetti Western and Meatballs&#8221; Season 1, Episode 9. The rediscovery of an old Western movie excites Bob (H. Jon Benjamin AGAIN) and son Gene (Eugene Mirman), making younger daughter Louise feel edged out of father-daughter TV bonding time. Louise&#8217;s realization at the end&#8211;that she doesn&#8217;t have much time to be one of the guys before puberty ruins everything&#8211;poignantly arrives while hiding in a jungle gym with Bob and Gene. Is it emotion bringing a tear to my eye, or is it the cloud of farts?</p>
<p><strong>Voted most likely to</strong> make you resent Italian food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Rick and Morty</h2>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rick_And_Morty_Something_Ricked_This_Way_Comes.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1962" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rick_And_Morty_Something_Ricked_This_Way_Comes-300x150.jpg" alt="Rick And Morty Something Ricked This Way Comes" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Creators:</strong> Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> So funny you might die.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Ubiquitous whiteness. Hard to get used to eyeballs&#8217; asterisk pupils. Binge-watching make one feel slightly ill, like reading two tabloids or eating a whole movie theater box of Hot Tamales before the trailers are over. Not sure why.</p>
<p><strong>How it passes:</strong> Rick&#8217;s obvious preference for Morty leaves teenage daughter Summer (Spencer Grammer) feeling left out&#8211;a complaint she loudly voices. Instead of remaining a wet blanket (<em>a la</em> early Lisa Simpson) or a punching bag (<em>a la</em> later Meg Griffin), Summer muscles her way in on adventures and has to deal with the consequences&#8211;fun and not fun. Does this happen only once, perhaps in a throwaway &#8220;Summer episode&#8221;? No. Her agenda and character arc keep steering stories and fueling the canon for the rest of the season. Meanwhile the mother, Beth (Sarah Chalke) contends with an unwanted suitor, doubts about her marriage, and the gore-smeared pressures of being a truly great horse heart surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Cartoon Network, Mondays at 10:30 PM EST</p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Episode:</strong> &#8220;Raising Gazorpazorp&#8221; (Season 1 Episode 7) is great, and features <i>Farscape</i> and <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> favorite Claudia Black, but it&#8217;s patently about men-are-like-this and women-are-like-that and so not really representative of what women usually get to do on the show. Sample instead &#8220;Something Ricked This Way Comes&#8221; (Season 1 Episode 9), where teenage daughter Summer (Spencer Grammer) finds a father figure in The Devil. This episode also includes the rapidly-becoming-iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekP0LQEsUh0#t=32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;pass the butter&#8221;</a> scene. Or&#8211;you know what?&#8211;start with the pilot and watch the whole season. It&#8217;s only 11 episodes. There are no bad ones.</p>
<p><strong>Voted most likely to</strong> leave you slightly squicked out and slightly shattered.</p>
