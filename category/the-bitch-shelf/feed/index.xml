										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that 2020 was not the best year. For anyone. But it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a good year for reading, what with all the quarantine and wanting to escape from reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a note: most of these books did not come out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020. Instead, these are the best of all the books that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I personally read </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2020, not including re-reads. As usual, these picks are big on diversity, as well as quality. Out of a total of 25 reads, these are my favorite:</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witchmark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by C. L. Polk (and its sequel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stormsong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Adult, Epic Fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an original world reminiscent of Edwardian England in the shadow of a World War, cabals of noble families use their unique magical gifts to control the fates of nations, while one young man seeks only to live a life of his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic marked Miles Singer for suffering the day he was born, doomed either to be enslaved to his family&#8217;s interest or to be committed to a witches&#8217; asylum. He went to war to escape his destiny and came home a different man, but he couldn’t leave his past behind. The war between Aeland and Laneer leaves men changed, strangers to their friends and family, but even after faking his own death and reinventing himself as a doctor at a cash-strapped veterans&#8217; hospital, Miles can’t hide what he truly is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a fatally poisoned patient exposes Miles’ healing gift and his witchmark, he must put his anonymity and freedom at risk to investigate his patient’s murder. To find the truth he’ll need to rely on the family he despises, and on the kindness of the most gorgeous man he’s ever seen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay close attention and you might solve this.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bronwyn, </span><b>the brain,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addy,</span><b> the beauty,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the picture-perfect homecoming princess.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nate, </span><b>the criminal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is already on probation for dealing.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper, </span><b>the athlete</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the all-star baseball pitcher.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon,</span><b> the outcast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention Simon is dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn’t an accident. On Monday, he died, but on Tuesday, he’d planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates. Which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who’s still on the loose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City in the Middle of the Night</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Charlie Jane Anders<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Adult, Science Fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity clings to life on January―a colonized planet divided between permanently frozen darkness on one side, and blazing endless sunshine on the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two cities, built long ago in the meager temperate zone, serve as the last bastions of civilization―but life inside them is just as dangerous as the uninhabitable wastelands outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie, a young student from the wrong side of Xiosphant city, is exiled into the dark after being part of a failed revolution. But she survives―with the help of a mysterious savior from beneath the ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burdened with a dangerous, painful secret, Sophie and her ragtag group of exiles face the ultimate challenge―and they are running out of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the City in the Middle of the Night.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Adult, Urban Fantasy/Paranormal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mermaid’s supernatural beauty serves one purpose: to lure a sailor to his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Massacre is supposed to bring peace to Eriana Kwai. Every year, the island sends its warriors to battle these hostile sea demons. Every year, the warriors fail to return. Desperate for survival, the island must decide on a new strategy. Now, the fate of Eriana Kwai lies in the hands of twenty battle-trained girls and their resistance to a mermaid’s allure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen-year-old Meela has already lost her brother to the Massacre, and she has lived with a secret that’s haunted her since childhood. For any hope of survival, she must overcome the demons of her past and become a ruthless mermaid killer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, Eriana Kwai’s Massacre warriors are female, and Meela must fight for her people’s freedom on the Pacific Ocean’s deadliest battleground.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[“The Black guy dies first” is one of the oldest, most harmful cliches in Hollywood.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Black guy dies first” is one of the oldest, most harmful cliches in Hollywood. We all know, from the very start of the horror movie, that the only characters with any chance of survival are the ones with a skin tone lighter than skim milk. Which not only kills a lot of the tension in the story, it also contributes to the dehumanizing of non-white people, which is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not okay.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this year’s Spooky Season, I thought I’d list five personal favorite horror movies and television shows that star people of color. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of them will die, but that’s just the genre. We can’t save all of them, or it wouldn’t be horror. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FYI: three of these listings are created by Jordan Peele. I’m not sorry, but Hollywood should be. (I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">am </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sorry that I haven’t seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antebellum </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet. It’s on my list, I swear!)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train to Busan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it cheating to use a foreign film set in a country where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a Person of Color by American standards? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who cares. I’m doing it anyway. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train to Busan </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a Korean zombie film about fatherhood and family. All the refugees get on a</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_21938" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21938" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-21938" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Train_to_Busan-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Train_to_Busan-210x300.jpg 210w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Train_to_Busan.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21938" class="wp-caption-text">kinopoisk.ru</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">train to go to the fortified city of Busan to escape the zombie plague, but a few zombies get on, too. So the refugees have to carefully creep from car to car, trying to survive not just the undead but also infighting. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of those movies with the theme of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">humans are the </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monsters, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but also manages to highlight some of our better qualities, too. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Descent Part 2</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descent </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movie was about a group of women going spelunking in a cave filled with monsters. Part 2 is about the rescue mission going in after them and running into the same problem. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was one woman of color in the first movie, and she was kind of a villain. In the sequel, one of the rescuers is a WOC, and she gets to make it to the end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While arguably not Jordan Peele’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creation, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely caught everyone’s attention and was a great introduction to drama and horror for the comedian. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already heard, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the story of a Black man visiting his white girlfriend’s family for the first time. What follows is a horror story with the type of creepiness that gets under your skin and crawls there, loaded with themes of institutional racism in modern America. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I didn’t like this movie as much as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I did enjoy seeing members of the <em>Black Panther</em> cast play TOTALLY DIFFERENT characters, and seeing the two family dynamics play <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-21940 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Us_2019_theatrical_poster-189x300.png" alt="" width="189" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Us_2019_theatrical_poster-189x300.png 189w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Us_2019_theatrical_poster.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" />out. How Winston Duke managed to go from M&#8217;Baku to a big, lumbering dork, I will never know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest criticisms of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was that it excluded the plight of Black women. Jordan Peele took that criticism to heart, and while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes two families, it focuses on the mother. In this story, everyone has a clone, but doesn’t know. At least, until those clones rise up and start murdering their originals. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovecraft Country</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Out </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">were a bit subtle with its themes of race. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovecraft Country </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">says “fuck it,” explicitly talking about race and privilege in almost every episode. This is partly because it’s set in the 1950s, and partly because it seems Jordan Peele is settling into his style, which has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. No complaints here, though. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Black Korean War vet returns home in search of his missing father, and runs head-first into a secret underworld of Lovecraftian monsters and cultists. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I especially love this premise because H. P. Lovecraft was a notorious racist, even for his time, who hated anyone who wasn’t an educated white person of “good breeding.” So having his monsters and stories center explicitly around Black heroes is such beautiful poetic justice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Season one just wrapped up on HBO, and I am counting the days to season two. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my Facebook friends has come down with the ‘Rona. She’s fine (asymptomatic), but&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my Facebook friends has come down with the ‘Rona. She’s fine (asymptomatic), but is still going into quarantine and asked for television recommendations. I’ve decided to list my personal top ten science fiction and fantasy television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listed in order from kid-friendly to very much </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kid-friendly. These all include women characters, most have major characters of color, and several have LGBTQ+ representation, as well.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar: the Last Airbender</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated G<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19766 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/avatar.jpeg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still the best animated show to ever grace television. If you haven’t seen this, you have such a treat ahead of you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an epic fantasy about a world torn apart by a century of war. The Avatar, master of all four elements, is tasked with bringing peace and balance back to the world. Only problem: he’s twelve years old. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dragon Prince</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated G <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19768 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dragon-prince.jpeg" alt="" width="190" height="266" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already watched and re-watched </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll want to check out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dragon Prince</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has one of the same creators, and Sokka’s voice actor, so there’s a lot of similar themes and styles. The biggest difference is that dragons play a larger role, there are elves, and the magic is less elemental and more wizard-y. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this one is ongoing. Season four will come out&#8230;eventually. When is COVID supposed to be done, again? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I did a longer, spoiler-free review on my blog </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/tv-review-the-dragon-prince"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated G<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19769 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/she-ra-158x300.jpeg" alt="" width="158" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/she-ra-158x300.jpeg 158w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/she-ra.jpeg 163w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lot </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more gay. The internet is calling it the lesbian kids’ show, and IT IS AMAZING. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did a more complete (spoiler-free) review of this show on YouTube </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr6F6pY7GQc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the basic premise is: Adora is the Chosen One, she’s got issues from an abusive upbringing, and all the deep themes of gray morality and complex leadership decisions are hidden by rainbows and pink sparkles. All but one romantic relationship on screen is gay, and one of the characters in later seasons is nonbinary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">great </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you’re looking for LGBTQ+ representation in kid-friendly media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated PG-13<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19770 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fullmetal.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be confused with plain ol’ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fullmetal Alchemist</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 2003 show that sharply veers from the manga. It’s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s not nearly as good as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brotherhood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two teenage brothers seek the mystical Philosopher’s Stone in order to return their mangled bodies to normal; Ed lost an arm and a leg, and Al lost his whole body when they tried to bring their dead mother back to life. (Needless to say, it failed.) As they work to undo their mistake, they run into artificial humans, murderers, and a massive government conspiracy that will destroy a whole country if they don’t stop it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also Ed loses his mind every other episode whenever someone calls him “short.” It’s hilarious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Good Place</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated PG-13<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19771 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/good-place.jpeg" alt="" width="184" height="273" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paranormal sitcom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Full spoiler-free review </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/tv-review-the-good-place"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleanor Shellstrop wakes up in the afterlife, specifically the Good Place, thanks to all the good deeds she did in life. Only problem: she never did any good deeds when she was alive. But if anyone else finds out, she’ll be condemned to the Bad Place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleanor and her friends have to play cat-and-mouse with the Good Place’s architect Michael, and his all-knowing assistant Janet, hiding in plain sight as Eleanor learns how to be ethical to earn her spot in the pleasant afterlife. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This show is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hilarious</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivering laughs while also tackling some really spicy ethical issues. It’s also got a really sweet romantic subplot and some truly tear-jerking season finales. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowpiercer</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated PG-13/R<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19772 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/snow-piercer.jpeg" alt="" width="188" height="268" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Full spoiler-free review </span><a href="https://www.thenerddaily.com/review-snowpiercer-season-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far there’s only one season of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowpiercer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although season two has been confirmed, and they had filmed all but the last two episodes before COVID shut everything down in March. (D’oh!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has become a frozen wasteland, and the only survivors live on the massive train </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snowpiercer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 1,001 cars long. The rich live in the head, first class. Laborers are in second and third class. And the stowaways&#8211;those who could not afford tickets and could not secure jobs&#8211;are shoved in the tail. They’re forced to endure horrendous conditions, and are ready for revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can imagine, this show is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relevant today. Anyone who wants a contextualized story about class and social injustice is going to want to check it out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Daveed Diggs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, Daveed Diggs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watchmen</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated R<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19773 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/watchman.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superhero</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My faith in HBO was shaken by the last couple of seasons of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watchmen </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-secured it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one-season show is based on the graphic novel of the same name, but you don’t have to read it to understand what’s happening. I went into this totally blind, having never read the graphic novel or seen the movie, and was able to follow along just fine.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watchmen </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">talks about police brutality and racism in a dystopic superhero world, and is single-handedly responsible for most of the U.S. learning about the Tulsa Massacre. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovecraft Country</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated R<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19774 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lovecraft-country-158x300.jpeg" alt="" width="158" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lovecraft-country-158x300.jpeg 158w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lovecraft-country.jpeg 163w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horror</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of my writing this, I’ve only seen the first four episodes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovecraft Country</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I love it. Jordan Peele is going into cosmic horror, and he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nails </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it. I find it especially awesome because H. P. Lovecraft was horribly racist even for the standards of the time, so the fact that his universe of cosmic horror is being re-written to star black people is just the icing on the cake. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovecraft Country </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes place in 1954 America, so in addition to terrifying monsters, cultists, and ghosts, the main characters also have to deal with ‘50s racism. I’m talking sunset towns and burning crosses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atticus is a war veteran from WWII who’s looking for his missing father, and is joined by his uncle George and childhood friend/person who steals the show, Leti. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just watch it for Leti. She’s the best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick and Morty</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated R<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-19775 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rick-and-morty.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I describe </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick and Morty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Dark humor, nihilism, meta commentary with occasional breaks of the fourth wall, a method of worldbuilding that can only be described as “fuck it, who cares”&#8230;it’s a class on its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick is the smartest man in the universe&#8211;in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">verse&#8211;and has moved in with his adult daughter and her family. He and his grandson Morty go on adventures all across the galaxy. Most of the episodes are vignettes that don’t have any bearing on each other (except maybe a callback later on), but there are a handful of overarching plotlines that tie everything together: Beth’s abandonment issues, her and Jerry’s marriage, and my personal favorite, Evil Morty and the Citadel of Ricks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your type of humor is “I’m going to Hell for laughing at this,” you’ll want to check out this series.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castlevania</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rated R<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19776 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/castlevania-158x300.jpeg" alt="" width="158" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/castlevania-158x300.jpeg 158w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/castlevania.jpeg 163w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Full spoiler-free review </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/castlevania-tv-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 15th Century, Dracula falls in love with and marries a human woman. But he only gets a few years with her before she’s burned at the stake for “witchcraft.” Dracula decides that all humans suck now&#8211;which, you know, fair&#8211;and plans to exterminate all of them with a bloodthirsty army of hellspawn. A trio of heroes&#8211;the vampire hunter Belmont, the mage Sypha, and Dracula’s half-vampire son Alucard&#8211;set off to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very bloody, very grimdark show that left us on a bit of a cliffhanger in season three. Again, production was stopped with COVID. But I’m looking forward to season four. One villain might become a hero, and a hero might turn into a villain. We just don’t know. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Writing young adult novels is hard enough, no matter what the genre is. But there’s&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing young adult novels is hard enough, no matter what the genre is. But there’s an extra obstacle, especially in fantasy and science fiction: no responsible parent would let the teenage “Chosen One” put themselves in the type of danger YA sci-fi/fantasy demands, no more than a real-life parent would let their sixteen-year-old enlist in the military. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it: how far would Harry have realistically gone if any of the adults r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-19410 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-potter-wand-300x170.png" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-potter-wand-300x170.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-potter-wand-1024x580.png 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-potter-wand-768x435.png 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-potter-wand.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">esponsible for him had stepped up to the plate and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> let him run head-first into constant danger? If his parents had survived, or Sirius Black had been allowed to take him in? We wouldn’t have a series. (Of course, we wouldn’t have a problematic TERF author, either, but that’s an article for another time.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most writers circumvent this issue in one of two ways. Sometimes, the parents are there, but they’re abusive/negligent/bad parents. In that case, we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our hero to leave the clutches of their harmful home life, because slaying dragons and blowing up death stars is better than being smacked by the people who are supposed to protect you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the author doesn’t want to give the teenager such a harsh upbringing, then there’s something of the Holy Grail of sci-fi/fantasy writers: orphan protagonists. Parents can’t interfere with the plot if they’re dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a problem: if writers use the same pattern too much, it creates a cliche, which is bad because they bore your readers. Not to mention the majority of teenagers reading your books are neither orphans nor victims of an abusive home life, which makes it harder for them to connect with your main character. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you let a teen protagonist have responsible parents without interfering with your plot? There are three ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1: Parents Get Kidnapped or Taken</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-19411 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Percy_Jackson__the_Olympians_The_Lightning_Thief_poster-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Percy_Jackson__the_Olympians_The_Lightning_Thief_poster-203x300.jpg 203w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Percy_Jackson__the_Olympians_The_Lightning_Thief_poster.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Percy’s mother Sally desperately tries to get Percy to Camp Half-Blood in the story’s catalyst, where he’ll be safe from all the Greek monsters trying to kill him. She succeeds, but vanishes in a beam of light, and Percy thinks she’s dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as it turns out, she’s not dead! She’s just been kidnapped and is being held hostage by Hades, god of the Underworld. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few other books kidnap the parents of their protagonist, usually to trigger their crazy adventure with the end goal of saving them. This effectively gets the parents out of the way while also providing a goal and higher stakes for the hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2: Run Away!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her parents&#8211;especially her father&#8211;do not want her to leave the island for an adventure even if it’s to save their village. So she just leaves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tells the audience two things: the threat to Moana’s island is big enough to overcome her <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-19412 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Moana-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Moana-202x300.jpg 202w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Moana.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" />desire to obey her family’s wishes, and that Moana is not going to let rules get in the way of achieving her goal. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mulan </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">did basically the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of reasons for a protagonist to just outright leave their parents for adventure. Maybe they had an intense argument and the teen is angry. Maybe the teen doesn’t want to get their parents wrapped up in the danger. Maybe the parents are sick or busy with some other problem. There are plenty of possibilities here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3: Give the Parent(s) a Narrative Arc</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is the trickiest to pull off, but it can be done, and the pay-off is amazing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Train Your Dragon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hiccup isn’t the only one who has to accept the truth about dragons and himself. His father Stoick also has to realize that his son’s differences are what make him stronger, regardless of whether or not they’re traditionally Viking. In the climax of the movie, Stoick gives Hiccup his blessing to be a dragonrider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This works for two reasons: one, Hiccup and the other kids are the only dragonriders, and thus <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-19413 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_Poster-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_Poster-202x300.jpg 202w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_Poster.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" />the only ones capable of defeating the Dragon Queen. If any of the adults tried, they’d be toast. And two, it’s Viking culture, which regularly endangers children’s lives throughout the movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the core principle is sound: Stoick has his own narrative arc of seeing Hiccup for who he really is and learning to listen to his son. Killing him off before he finished that arc would damage the story. (I know he dies in the sequel, but that happens after his relationship with Hiccup is patched up, so </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shhhh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how you let a parent survive a young adult story without hindering the young adult in question. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve made no secret about my disdain for romantic subplots, especially on this column. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve also recently come out as aroace (aromantic asexual) to the shock of absolutely nobody, and wanted to do a post commemorating that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the amount of aroace characters in SFF is shockingly low. I know of only two. So I’m compromising with a list of sci-fi/fantasy books that have either no romantic subplot or is very, very light on it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Links lead to more in-depth, spoiler-free reviews. As always, please list your own suggestions in the comments so I can check them out.</span></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/trials-of-apollo-the-dark-prophecy-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trials of Apollo</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Rick Riordan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young adult</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Trials of Apollo</em> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the story of the Greek god Apollo—alias Lester Papadopoulos—who has been stripped of his divine powers and flung to Earth as a sixteen-year-old boy. He has to go on a cross-country, extremely dangerous quest to save the world and also get his divinity back. It’s a five-book redemption arc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s joined by Meg, the twelve-year-old daughter of Demeter. While the bond they share is strong and full of love, it’s purely platonic. Apollo is a big bisexual mess who has absolutely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">time for a romantic subplot. It’s beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third series in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percy Jackson </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">universe. While you’ll miss a lot of callbacks, you can jump right into the first </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials of Apollo </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">book without reading the others and still know what’s going on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/book-review-dealing-in-dreams"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-align alignleft wp-image-18098 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-190x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-190x300.jpg 190w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-650x1024.jpg 650w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-768x1210.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-975x1536.jpg 975w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing-1300x2048.jpg 1300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dealing.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" />Dealing in Dreams</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Lilliam Rivera</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young adult</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dystopian</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post-apocalyptic novel is set in a brutal dystopia where the streets are ruled by girl gangs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several tropes get turned on their head, and we get a good look at how beauty can be found in even the worst of circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nalah—who usually goes by the name Chief Rocka—is born into the violent matriarchal Mega City, where seven-year-old girls are recruited into military camps and teenagers being beaten to death is the norm. It&#8217;s a TERF&#8217;s paradise, and Nalah has swallowed the lies fed to her hook, line, and sinker. That is, until she’s sent on a mission outside the city limits and has to choose between her own ambition and the safety of her gang. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like <em>The </em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Trials of Apollo</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there’s also a lot of LGBTQ+ representation in this book. Nalah herself is straight, and is in something of a relationship with another character. But that only takes a handful of pages in the entire book.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/dread-nation-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Dread Nation</em></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/deathless-divide-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deathless Divide</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Justina Ireland</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young adult</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will not stop recommending this series until everyone has read it. Especially anyone interested in historical fiction and/or zombies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zombies rose during the Battle of Gettysburg, completely derailing the Civil War and American history. At the start of the books—1880—the undead are mostly (not really) under control, and the States have something of a system: black girls are trained to be Attendants, personal bodyguards/zombie-killers, for their rich (white) employers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emotional core of the story is the friendship between Jane and Katherine, two Attendants-in-training who go from enemies to rivals to allies to friends. To top it off, Katherine is the only aroace character I’ve yet to see, and a true artist with a pair of short swords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> by Hiromu Arakawa<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-19162 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fullmetal123-191x300.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fullmetal123-191x300.jpg 191w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fullmetal123.jpg 252w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young/new adult</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically a manga, but who cares? I’m counting it as a book series. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fullmetal Alchemist </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">follows two brothers—Ed and Al Elric—as they search for the mystical Philosopher’s Stone. Their quest gets them embroiled in a nation-wide, centuries-old conspiracy theory that threatens everything and everyone they love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed does eventually develop a reciprocated crush on the character Winry, who makes his mechanical prosthetics and is his best childhood friend. But I especially love the character Colonel Mustang, an arrogant, self-sacrificing bastard who can blow stuff up with a snap of his fingers. There’s a fan theory that he has a thing with his lieutenant, the no-nonsense sharpshooter Riza Hawkeye, but it’s not canon, and I prefer to see them as self-adopted siblings. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/the-guns-above-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Guns Above</em></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/interview-with-sci-fi-author-robyn-bennis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robyn Bennis</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult (PG-13)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This steampunk novel about militarized airships is a feminist masterpiece. Lieutenant Josette Dupre is promoted as the first female captain in her nation’s military and given command of her own ship, but the entire world is stacked against her, waiting for her to fail as she tries to save her hometown and her country from an ambush. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was worried there would be a romantic subplot between her and Bernat, who is sent aboard her ship to spy on her and eventually comes around to her side completely. But instead of “redemption through love,” it’s “redemption through friendship,” and I love it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This does have a sequel, </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/by-fire-above-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Fire Above</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where Josette does end up in a romantic relationship with Bernat’s older brother, which they both start purely to spite Bernat and end up in something real. As an older sister, I can confirm that I, too, would start a relationship with someone purely to annoy my brother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Book Thief</em> by Markus Zusak</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult (PG-13)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Book Thief</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’re missing out on a truly haunting, breathtaking read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is told from the point of view of Death during WWII. Hard to beat that for a narrator. He tells the story of a young girl who gets adopted by a German family and ends up hiding a Jew in their basement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the main character is a little girl, no romantic subplot!</span></p>
<p><em><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-19163 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/poppy-war-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/poppy-war-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/poppy-war.jpg 317w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/the-poppy-war-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poppy War</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by R. F. Kuang</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult (rated R)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epic fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world heavily inspired by late Imperial China, Rin is from a small farm town that she will do anything to escape. She ends up winning a scholarship to the most prestigious military school in the Empire, meets a host of allies, rivals, and enemies, and then is thrown head-first into a war that her country cannot hope to win without serious divine help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the history and culture is cut straight from a Chinese history book, the gods are something else. There are a variety of nasty, powerful deities that people can call upon for terrifying power, and they have their own agendas that rarely benefit humanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book has a sequel that I could never get into. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poppy War </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an intense, gritty tragedy with one of the most hard-core anti-heroes I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. </span></p>

Earlier this month I did a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woRZOZ-KIhs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> listing my top ten books that feature LGBTQ+ characters. But with everything that’s happened since, I wanted to take another look at that list. Specifically, highlighting the LGBTQ+ characters of color, who tend to be erased even within the queer communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for this Bitch Shelf article, I’m drawing attention to some fantastic sci-fi and fantasy books that specifically center around LGBTQ+ characters of color. It’s a mix of young adult, adult, and some grimdark, so you’ll hopefully find something that catches your attention here. The links lead to more in-depth books reviews, none of them containing spoilers. (Please keep it that way in the comments.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/mermaids-of-eriana-kwai-trilogy-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mermaids of Eriana Kwai Trilogy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/interview-with-tiana-warner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana Warner</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a paranormal young adult romance featuring flesh-eating mermaids at war with the native island of Eriana Kwai. The first book—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice Massacre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—follows Meela, a human about to go on her first Massacre. The Massacres are a ceremonial hunt where twenty people go out into the ocean and murder as many mermaids as they can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is bad for Meela, because her best friend is a mermaid who eventually becomes her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Eriana Kwai is fictional, the culture is heavily inspired by Native Alaskans and northwestern Native Americans. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/dread-nation-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dread Nation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Justina Ireland</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dread Nation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a young adult alternative history novel that takes place in 1880, almost twenty years after the first zombies showed up at Gettysburg. In this America, black girls are trained in the art of killing zombies to protect their white employers. Jane McKeene is one such girl who uncovers a conspiracy theory and ends up in the wild west, where she gets to deal with both zombies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">raging racists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Jane and her frenemy Kate are part of the LGBTQ+ community. Jane is bisexual, spending most of book one with the company of men before getting herself a girlfriend in book two. Kate, a fellow zombie-killer from Jane’s class, is both asexual and aromantic, and a true artist with a pair of short swords. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/godshaper-by-simon-spurrier-graphic-novel-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Godshaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Simon Spurrier</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(We’ve officially entered the adult section of the bookshelf for these last three picks.)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Godshaper </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a graphic novel set in a world where everyone has their own personal god. These gods appeared shortly after all electricity and machines mysteriously stopped. People can use their gods to do pretty much anything, but they don’t have much power </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their gods. If they want to increase a god’s power or change its appearance, they go to a godshaper. Godshapers don’t have gods, but they have the ability to change them. This makes them pariahs, and they usually travel alone because they’re chased out of every town they come across with pitchforks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main character is a pansexual godshaper and part-time musician who finds a god without a human, which shouldn’t even exist, and thus gets dragged kicking and screaming into a <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18902 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/woman-holding-flag-2577814-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />conspiracy theory. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book follows an Inuit man, Omat, who is…well, if he’d been born anywhere else, he’d have been assigned female at birth. But because of certain Inuit customs, he’s raised as a man and fully identifies as a man even though he’s biologically female. Because of those same customs, he’s trained as a shaman and gets magic powers as he learned to communicate with the gods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, he’s a magic trans baby. Also, Vikings are washing up on his shores—oh, and the Norse and Inuit gods are real and most of them want Omat dead for one reason or the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one has a lot of dark moments—transphobia and sexism, animal death, rape—but there’s a really sweet, happy ending. Unlike the last book on our list…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/book-review-black-leopard-red-wolf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Leopard Red Wolf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Marlon James</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Leopard Red Wolf </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an epic fantasy grimdark in a world heavily based on African history and mythology. The main character, Tracker, is tasked with finding a missing boy and has to fight through corrupt men and terrifying monsters in order to do it. Needless to say, 90% of all the characters wind up dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a story with no real heroes, no happy ending, and all the characters are a hot gay mess. Tracker, his first boyfriend, his villain boyfriend, his final boyfriend, his shapeshifting crush, everyone. It’s a good book, but it will make you very angry and sad, so don’t read it at work like I did. It makes the murder and rape scenes that much more awkward.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School is⁠—or will soon be⁠—out! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out. No more Zoom meetings with teachers or writing essays from your parents’ house. I’m writing this in early May, to be published late May, with the hope that COVID-19 will be under control enough that we can socialize again. Even us introverts are getting itchy. But even if we can finally leave our homes, bookworms are gonna bookworm. Even in the summer. Here’s a list of my favorite young adult novels in the sci-fi/fantasy genres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Same rules apply: every book has solid representation of girls/people of color/LGBTQ+ community, etc. Links lead to more detailed, spoiler-free reviews.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1.</strong> Your monthly reminder to read everything by Rick Riordan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percy Jackson </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">series, then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes of Olympus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials of Apollo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which happens concurrently with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus Chase </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trilogy. It’s a lot of books, but they’re all fast reads. It’s rare for me to take more than three days to finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical fiction, with zombies! In Justina Ireland’s alternate America, the dead rise a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t the battle of Gettysburg, calling off the Civil War and completely changing the course of history. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dread Nation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes place a couple of decades later, told from the point of view of a Black girl trained to be a bodyguard against the dead. So instead of the usual theme of “humans are the real monsters,” it’s more “racism is the real monster.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sequel recently came out, which I haven’t read yet. Talk to me again when I can go to the bookstore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flesh-eating mermaids trying to wipe out an island of people, featuring same-sex Romeo and Juliet! (Romia and Juliet?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, the humans of the slowly starving island send twenty men on a boat to kill as many mermaids as possible. The problem is, the mermaids have a siren-like ability, called the lure, which allows them to hypnotize men so they’re easier to kill. Finally, the humans start sending out women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue there is that the main character, Meela, is best friends with one of the mermaids, who eventually becomes her girlfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Latinx post-apocalyptic setting is ruled by a crime lord and her army of girl gangs. The main character is trying to get into the Towers, the most luxurious place in the city and the seat of power. But to get there, she has to do an undercover mission outside of the city. The resulting adventure forces her to question everything she’s ever known and believed in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very light in romance (huge plus for me), and since the goal is never “take down the dystopian government,” it’s not what happens. The focus is on the main character’s inner journey, not the unrealistic fall of a massive empire at the hands of a band of plucky teenagers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><em><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/throne-of-glass-series-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throne</span></a></em><i><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/throne-of-glass-series-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Glass </span></a></i><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/throne-of-glass-series-book-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sara J. Maas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This epic fantasy YA series is a beautiful mess of plot twists, magic, and romance. The main character is an assassin who, at the very beginning, is in the salt mines for her crimes against the tyrannical king. She gets pulled out because the king is having a secret competition of all the best assassins in the land to see who’s the best. The winner will serve as his own personal killer, a very cushy job with the resources our main character needs to stay out of the mines completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first couple of books are cool, but the series really gets momentum in book three. Not only do we uncover more about our main character’s past, but we also get introduced to some other major characters, including my personal favorite, the witch Manon. Honestly, just read it for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun science fact: some planets don’t rotate. One side is always facing the sun, and is so hot that anything less sturdy than stone will burst into flame. The other side is an icy wasteland, cold as Pluto. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City in the Middle of the Night </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is set on the planet January, which does not rotate. As such, all the humans live in the twilight zone, that one sliver of habitable living space. There are a handful of cities in that zone, and the political turmoil going on is more dangerous than the planet itself. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if Superman was a transgender teenager? That’s basically the premise of this two-book series. Dani is a closeted trans girl (assigned male at birth) until she inherits the power of Dreadnought, which⁠—on top of giving her super strength and flight⁠—also changes her body into her own personal ideal, which in this case, is a beautiful girl. It immediately outs her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of dealing with her emotionally abusive family and other personal dilemmas, Dani also has to deal with the superhero community. She’s got a couple of true allies, a few who only want her for her powers, and the “heroes” who are grossly prejudiced against her. (There’s a TERF who goes from antagonist to full-blown villain in book two, and gets an absolutely beautiful comeuppance.)</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m writing this in early April, to be published in late April. If I’m right&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m writing this in early April, to be published in late April. If I’m right (and depressingly enough, I probably will be), most of us will still be quarantine, or at least should be. I’ve already seen a dozen people online asking for book recommendations, so I thought I’d throw in my two cents. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, every BitchShelf recommendation has minority representation and is a fantastic story. I have cherry-picked the longer books and series from my collection for the purposes of this article, so it’ll hopefully take a few days for you to get through them. Links go to my more in-depth reviews.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/the-way-of-kings-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stormlight Archive</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Brandon Sanderson<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-17864 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TheWayOfKings-198x300.png" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TheWayOfKings-198x300.png 198w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TheWayOfKings.png 232w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are monster books, over a thousand pages each. It’s kind of like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in that there’s a million things going on plus a global threat, and it’s currently unfinished. Unlike </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have a solid release date for the next book (November 17th). The magic system is insane, the battles are intense, and the characters are fully fleshed out and complicated&#8211;even the paragons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also not grimdark, even though it still has darker moments and wrestles with larger issues. So it doesn’t feel like your faith in humanity is being shredded with every page. Well, more than it already is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick Riordan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, really. EVERYTHING. Start with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percy Jackson </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">series, work your way through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes of Olympus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials of Apollo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The last one is currently incomplete, as the final </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials of Apollo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> book comes out in September 2020. These are YA books about modern-day Greek and Roman gods, and they are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hilarious</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while also going into really deep issues of family and morality. There’s also a Norse god trilogy called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magnus Chase </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trilogy. What’s really fun is that, as the series progresses, you can see Riordan get better at writing and more inclusive, going from disabilities to women to people of color to same-sex relationships to genderfluid transgender. And these are all </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">major</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> characters, not sidelined tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, the author started an imprint series within Disney Publishing called Rick Riordan Presents. He finds YA authors who have similar books as his and sponsors them: Indian gods in the modern day, Mesopotamian gods, African American folktales&#8230;that’s enough to keep you going until we get a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">proper </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">apocalypse. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/throne-of-glass-series-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throne of Glass </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sara J. Maas</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-17865 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Throne-of-Glass-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Throne-of-Glass-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Throne-of-Glass.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a seven-book YA epic fantasy series full of plot twists, war, and romance. If I go into too much detail, it’ll be spoiled, and I’m trying to avoid going to reviewer hell, so this will be brief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve complained about the convoluted romantic subplots and lack of death in later books in this column, but it’s still a great read. A young assassin with a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">complicated past winds up in the service of an evil tyrant and has to figure out how to overthrow him. Every woman is either an assassin, a warrior, and/or has magic. The villains are the absolute scum of the earth, and when they go down it is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">beautiful</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/book-review-the-wolf-in-the-whale"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf in the Whale</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Jordanna Max Brodsky</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick Riordan did a funny YA trilogy about modern-day Norse gods. Jordanna Max Brodsky wrote a historical fantasy book about Norse </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inuit gods, and put it in the adult grimdark section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main character&#8211;a transgender Inuit shaman&#8211;ends up going to Norway in the Viking era and has to stop them from invading, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal with the Inuit gods who are split on whether to help her or kill her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest theme is sexual assault. The main character is a survivor of assault, while one of the other major characters is a former Viking&#8211;re: assaulter&#8211;who goes through a redemption arc. There are a few other trigger warnings to consider: violence, character death, animal death, religious persecution, transphobia, sexism, etc. But don’t worry: there is a happy ending, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">swear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-17866 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhoFearsDeathbook-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhoFearsDeathbook-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhoFearsDeathbook.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/who-fears-death-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Fears Death</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Nnedi Okorafor</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fantasy book dealing with sexual assault! Hooray! </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Fears Death </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is about a post-apocalyptic Africa, centered around a woman who is the product of rape, and as a result has both severe anger issues and magical powers. The first half of the book is her growing up and figuring out her powers, the second half is her going after her father. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worldbuilding is amazing, all the characters are complicated and fleshed out, and the story is one big engaging read. More bittersweet ending than happy ending, but in a grimdark story that’s usually the best you can hope for. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/the-guns-above-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guns Above</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/by-fire-above-book-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Fire Above</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Robyn Bennis</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airships! Platonic male-female friendships! Dismantling the patriarchy with epic battles and snippy sarcasm! </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guns Above </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a steampunk story about the first woman captain of an airship. She has to deal with a spy in her crew, several higher-ups who are waiting for her to fail, and of course a war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes this series unique from other steampunk is that Bennis, as a scientist, really digs into how exactly airship battles would play out. She goes into the technicalities of operating an airship, all the dangers and pitfalls, and makes it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">interesting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So there’s a lot of, “We’re trying to get to this place for a mission, but if we don’t fix this technical problem on the way then we’re all dead because this thing is full of helium.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a serious story full of characters who are sarcastic, hilarious bitches. You just can’t beat it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Your Book Idea Does (Not!) Suck</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17617 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cj-dayrit-xX2aYSBsyKo-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />&#8220;Where do you get your ideas&#8221; is a hated question in the writing community. Most authors just <i>do</i>. Ideas just kind of appear from the nether, or are gifted from &#8220;the muse,&#8221; or hit us like a train while we&#8217;re taking a shower. It&#8217;s widely accepted in the writing community that story ideas are random. That they&#8217;re rare golden nuggets that only a lucky few get to uncover.</p>
<p>But. Did you know that you can actually generate story ideas at will?</p>
<p>The process tends to be a little different for each author. But it exists. Career authors need to be able to generate story ideas at will. But how do you do that? How do you &#8220;tame the muse&#8221;?</p>
<p>​Here are some ideas.</p>
<h2><b>Creativity Begets Creativity</b></h2>
<p>One of my favorite sources of writing ideas is other stories. This is true for a lot of writers. Read the ancient classic <i>Beowulf </i>and then Tolkien&#8217;s <i>The Hobbit</i>, and you&#8217;ll see what I mean. Creativity begets creativity. It&#8217;s really fun to watch a movie or read a book and think about how the story would have turned out if the characters had acted differently, or if they were placed in a totally different setting.</p>
<p>Recently, many people will ask these questions, like, &#8220;What if Harry Potter was sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor,&#8221; and stop right there. They&#8217;ll write a fanfic story about that. Which is totally fine, and as both a reader and writer of fanfiction I&#8217;m not in any position to argue this. But if you want to be a professional author—that is, someone who gets paid for writing original stories—then you&#8217;re going to have to get&#8230;well, original.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take that Harry Potter idea and break it down. The idea is that there&#8217;s a new kid on the block—we&#8217;ll call him Barry—who&#8217;s going to a fantastical world that separates people into groups. Each group has its own stereotype: the brave ones, the smart ones, the nice ones, and the evil ones. Obviously it&#8217;s a lot more complicated than that (and as a Huffleclaw, I have a few choice words about how &#8220;awesome&#8221; and &#8220;good&#8221; Gryffindors are supposed to be), but that&#8217;s the impression Barry and the readers are getting. Note that in this story, you don&#8217;t need four groups. We can have three, seven, twenty, whatever.</p>
<p>So what happens if Barry ends up in the &#8220;evil&#8221; group, rather than the &#8220;good&#8221; group like he wanted, like everyone around him expected? You get a hell of a lot of character development is what you get.</p>
<p>The world-building is completely up in the air. It could be a magic school, but everyone&#8217;s going to see it as a Hogwarts knockoff, so maybe avoid that. Instead, we could make it a superhero academy, or a science fiction setting where the school is in outer space, or an underground paranormal school full of vampires and werewolves.</p>
<p>The story itself would focus on Barry, who now has to interact with people he initially thought of as jerks but turn out to actually be pretty awesome, proving that the &#8220;evil&#8221; house is really not evil, just stereotyped. He&#8217;ll probably have to save the world (it’s a YA novel, after all) and confront some parts of himself that he&#8217;d really rather not examine, like his tendency to let his ambition cloud his friendships, or how he feels he <i>always </i>has to be in charge, even to the detriment of others.</p>
<p>Basically, you ask a question of a story that you really like, and then create new characters and settings to answer that question. The story will then write itself.<b></b></p>
<h2><b>Turn Your History Geek On</b></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a widely-known fact that George R. R. Martin&#8217;s <i>Game of Thrones </i>series was largely inspired by the real-life War of the Roses, which took place in England in the 15th Century. He basically just added ice zombies, direwolves, and of course, dragons.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17618 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/junior-ferreira-7esRPTt38nI-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>Studying history is a good idea for a variety of reasons, especially for writers, but it can also be a wellspring of inspiration. Especially when you take in ancient religious beliefs and mythologies. What if the ancient Aztec gods were real and angry at the recent lack of blood sacrifices? Can you create a space empire modeled after Imperial China? Maybe model one of your characters after an unknown or overlooked historical figure.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just history. Science—especially biology—is another really great source of inspiration. Creatures of the deep blue sea are the stuff of nightmares, so stick them in a horror setting! Take a crack at paleontology to see what extinct animals you can dust off and use in a fantasy world. Base your next fantasy world off of poisonous plants in the Amazon. Go nuts!</p>
<h2><b>The Internet!</b></h2>
<p>I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t acknowledge the Internet. There are hundreds of websites specifically designed to cough out writing prompts. These can be serious to just plain silly. But they work. Google &#8220;writing prompt generator&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>The internet also has an endless stream of art, which in and of itself can be turned into a writing prompt. This can be for a full-blown story or just a basic writing exercise to get the juices flowing. (See <a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/guest-post-rustic-pursuit-short-story-by-jim-webster">&#8220;Rustic Pursuits&#8221;</a> for an example.) But google something like &#8220;dragon art&#8221; or &#8220;post-apocalyptic setting,&#8221; choose an image, and write a story based on what you see.</p>
<h2><b>Don&#8217;t Sweat It. (Seriously, Don&#8217;t.)</b></h2>
<p>In the end, the story idea doesn&#8217;t actually account for all that much. It might encourage people to pick up your book, but if it&#8217;s not written well—that is, has engaging characters and an intriguing plot—then readers are going to drop it like a hot brick. Conversely, you can have the most overused story idea of all time—say, a chosen one selected by a prophecy to defeat the dark lord—and if it&#8217;s written really, really well, then you&#8217;re fine.</p>
<p>Your story idea may be the most ridiculous idea ever. But story ideas are really just the start. It&#8217;s all in the development and execution of that idea that a writer&#8217;s skill is judged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17389 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/christina-wocintechchat-com-UTw3j_aoIKM-unsplash-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ah, Black History Month. It’s an annual reminder to us white people that we used to be really racist as a society. And wouldn’t you know it, we still are! In <i>every</i> level of society. And yes, that includes the book industry. I was scrolling through my Favorites list on my blog while preparing this article and realized that about 90% of the authors on my shelves are white.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>While I make some new orders on Amazon, I wanted to share five sci-fi/fantasy books I’ve read that <i>are </i>written by Black authors that I highly recommend you check out. Most of these I’ve reviewed on <a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog">my blog</a>, so I’ve included links if you want a more in-depth review unrestrained by Luna Station’s word limit.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered them in my own personal preference, based on several arbitrary rules that I’ll never be able to explain.</p>
<p>5:<a href="http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-hundred-thousand-kingdoms/"><i> The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms </i></a>by N. K. Jemisin</p>
<p>This was Jemisin’s debut novel, the first of a trilogy. It features gods enslaved by humans in a floating city. The world used to by ruled by a trio of gods in a polyamorous relationship, until one of them got jelly and killed one of their partners, causing a war, which the other god lost, and now they’re stuck serving humans. In short: communication is the key to any relationship, especially if world domination is on the docket.</p>
<p><i>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms </i>is told through the first person POV of the main character, who is new to the city, but also the granddaughter of the king. She grew up in this military matriarchal society as a warrior and now has to navigate the insane inroads of the political arena. Add a hefty dose of magic, romance, and death, and you can see why I plowed through this book in less than a week.</p>
<p>4: <a href="http://marlonjameswriter.com/books/black-leopard-red-wolf-tr"><i>Black Leopard, Red Wolf </i></a>by Marlon James</p>
<p>This one, I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, it’s a really good book, even if it is dark (see my <a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/book-review-black-leopard-red-wolf">original review</a> for all the trigger warnings). On the other hand, I’m a sucker for happy endings. I like to know that, after all the shit, at least <i>some </i>of the major characters will be alright.</p>
<p>They’re all either dead, insane, or in prison. Yay!</p>
<p>It’s been called “the African <i>Game of Thrones</i>,” which is an accurate statement. So if that, plus a <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17390 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/suad-kamardeen-8PyNdtGL4Bg-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />lot of gay, plus a hefty dose of tragedy is your jam, this is definitely the book for you. Just don’t read it while on break during a sales job, because it <i>will </i>ruin your good attitude and affect your numbers for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>3: <a href="http://www.nnedi.com/books/who_fears_death.html"><i>Who Fears Death </i></a>by Nnedi Okorafor</p>
<p>Really, anything by Nnedi Okorafor is gold, but this one is probably the best (with <i>Lagoon </i>being a close second).</p>
<p><i>Who Fears Death </i>is another African grimdark novel (again, <a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/who-fears-death-book-review">trigger warnings</a>), this one centered on Onye, who’s the product of rape and has the delightful combination of anger issues and magic. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic Africa, with several different cities, ethnic groups, and magic systems. While I wish that Okorafor had gone into the worldbuilding a little more, the focus is on Onye and her struggle to come to terms with herself and right the wrongs done to her family. Since this includes punching several rapists in the face, I’m on board with it.</p>
<p>2: <a href="https://clpolk.com/"><i>Witchmark </i></a>by C. L. Polk</p>
<p>Another debut novel, Polk hits the ground running with <i>Witchmark</i>, an amazing epic fantasy that dives into classism and mental health. Like <i>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</i>, the main character in <i>Witchmark </i>is a hot gay mess. But unlike James, Polk gives her protagonist and his slightly more emotionally stable boyfriend a happy ending.</p>
<p>In addition to larger societal issues, Polk also tackles emotional abuse and toxic family relationships, as the primary villain is the main character’s father, and also to a certain extent his sister. She’s in a weird gray area and has a whole redemption arc. She also stars in the sequel coming out this month.</p>
<p>1: <a href="http://justinaireland.com/dread-nation"><i>Dread Nation </i></a>by Justina Ireland</p>
<p>(full review <a href="http://www.dzamarie.com/blog/dread-nation-book-review">here</a>)</p>
<p>Badass black girls! Historically accurate alternative histories! Zombies!</p>
<p>Words cannot express how much my little historian’s heart squealed with joy when I found this book. Set during the Reconstruction Era after the zombie apocalypse sidelined the American Civil War, Ireland gives us a thrilling YA novel that tackles racism on every level. It goes a little hard on the “truly man is the real monster here” theme, but American history doesn’t leave much room for any other conclusion.</p>
<p>Also there’s a sequel coming out. At this point, I should just give Jeff Bezos a hundred dollars every year or so and let him spoon-feed me sequels as they come out.</p>
