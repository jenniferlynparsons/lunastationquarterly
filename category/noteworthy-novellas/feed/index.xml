					<description><![CDATA[Since we’re heading into winter here in the Northern Hemisphere, I decided to check out&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29016 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59823183-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59823183-211x300.jpg 211w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59823183.jpg 352w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" />Since we’re heading into winter </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">here in the Northern Hemisphere</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I decided to check out <a href="https://robotdinosaurpress.com/product/a-starbound-solstice-by-juliet-kemp/"><em>A Starbound Solstice</em></a>, by <a href="https://julietkemp.com/">Juliet Kemp</a>. This queer, cozy holiday story takes place in space, at the mid-point of the journey between Earth and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> first </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">planned human/alien shared colony</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">It’s a lovely </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">book</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> about choosing hope and trust over fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The story lingers over the opening, introducing the seven characters – five humans, the ship’s AI (Heron), and their alien liaison (Aliax) – as they plan a solstice celebration, combining the best of all of their respective winter holidays. It’s worth noting that every one of the human characters is queer. Three of them are in a poly relationship, and two use alternate pronouns (as does the alien, Aliax, though that feels less noteworthy). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Their holiday planning is interrupted when Heron begins to malfunction. This is a problem for the obvious reasons, but also because Heron controls their needledrive, the alien technology that will allow them to make this trip in a mere 70 years. Without it, it could take another thousand years to reach their destination. To make matters worse, Aliax – the only alien on the ship, and thus the only who understands how the needledrive works – falls ill shortly after Heron starts to glitch, and so xe can’t do much to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Fifty years before the ship left Earth, the Ferolyt – aliens like Aliax – helped humanity step back from the brink of self-destruction, giving humanity hope and a future. When our crew finds the source of Heron’s malfunction, they have to decide if they are going to hold onto that hope, or give in to fear. Will they take a risk in order to live up to their ideals, or will they take the route of self-interest and suspicion? The journey to get there is a bit predictable, but no less delightful for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I loved the interactions of the crew. This story </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">feels </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">cozy – even though they’ve only known each </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">for a little over a year, they feel like a family. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">There’s a real twenty-somethings, punk vibe to the group that I found endearing. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">That being said, there are too many characters for such a short book. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he plot only needed 3 of the human characters, if that. Fortunately, since most of them </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">seem to be there to add personality, and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">don’t </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">have much </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">impact the plot, it’s okay if you lose track of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">And what holiday story would be complete without a romantic subplot? The narrator (Linn) has a huge crush on the ship’s engineer (Taye). The rest of the crew constantly tease xyr about it, and xe spends a lot of time trying to determine whether or not they reciprocate. It’s sweetly done, and I enjoyed seeing two nonbinary people flirting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Overall, this is a sweet, low-key story. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">It’s enjoyable and wholesome, without demanding much from the reader.</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I salute Juliet Kemp. They have </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">written the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">optimistic,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> queer holiday story that my </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">frazzled</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> heart needed this season. If you, too, need a break from the chaos, <em>A Starbound Solstice</em> is worth checking out.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are many ways to fracture a fairy tale. You can move it to a&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img decoding="async" class="left-align alignleft wp-image-28742 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roses-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roses-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roses.jpg 317w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />There are many ways to fracture a fairy tale. You can move it to a different time or place. You can genderswap the characters. You can go post-modern, and make some or all of the characters genre-savvy (always a personal favorite of mine). </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n <a href="https://queenofswordspress.com/product/the-language-of-roses/"><em>The Language of Roses</em></a>, <a href="https://alpennia.com/">Heather Rose Jones</a> takes an entirely different tactic </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">with the</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> story of Beauty and the Beast. She keeps the b</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">asic fact of the</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> story, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">but by adding characters </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">shifting </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">established</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> motivations</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> she makes something entirely new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">We start off with the bare bones </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">of </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Beauty and the Beast. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">We have the dutiful daughter (Alys Levesque) who takes her father’s place in an enchanted manor, after he steals a rose from the residents. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">But this beauty is aromantic </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">(probably asexual, too, but this isn’t the kind of story to make that distinction), </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">which immediately makes for an interesting shift in dynamic</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Then w</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">e have a nobleman (Philippe du Fortigny) cursed with a beastly form after insulting and angering </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">one of the Fee (fairy-like beings)</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, whose curse can only be lifted by love freely given and returned. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">But </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Philippe learn</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s no</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> lessons from his curse, and remains an unpleasant person, never mind his looks. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The combination of those two changes would be enough to throw the story off its a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">xi</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s and create something new and interesting, but Jones d</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">oes</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n’t stop there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">There are a handful of new characters, each more interesting than the last. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The most notable is</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> Grace, Philippe’s sister.</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The same curse that </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> slowly turn</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ing</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> him into a beast, turns her to stone with each passing day. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Hers is a quiet, desperate presence, serving as an ally and guide for Alys. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Grace knows how the curse happened, knows what is needed to free herself, yet never pressures Alys in any way. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Her strength, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">loyalty</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, and bravery </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">wins Alys’ friendship</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and my respect. Then there is </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Eglantine, who Philippe courted thirty three years ago, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">whose presence is keenly felt through Grace’s memories and her own reverberating actions</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">And we mustn’t forget the rose itself, which started Alys on this </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">journey</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This is not a straightforward narrative. While most of the book is </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">from</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> Alys’ </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">point of view</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, she </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">not the only </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">narrator</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, and while the others all know more about what is going on that Alys does, habits of secrecy prevent them from sharing too much, even in their own thoughts. It takes most of the book before </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">we</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> see how all of these various threads weave together. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This can lead to some confusion on the first reading, but I found that my patience paid off in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">B</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">eauty and the Beast has always been a story about looking beyond appearances (among other themes), but this version extends that far beyond the original scope. Neither Alys nor Grace nor even the rosebush are what they originally appear. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">While there is a romantic relationship, it’s not the one you expect. Not everyone earns forgiveness, or a happily ever after. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Matters are not resolved in the way I anticipated. To say more of the ending would rob you of the discovery, but suffice it to say that everything comes to a very satisfying conclusion. I would highly recommend <em>The Language of Roses</em> for anyone who loves a fractured fairy tale, beautiful language, and lush mystery.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Uncommon Charm, by Emily Bergslien and Kat Weaver, lives up to its name. The frothy&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><a href="https://www.neonhemlock.com/books/uncommon-charm"><em><img decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-28400 size-medium" src="https://2f5f93.p3cdn2.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/charm-188x300.webp" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://2f5f93.p3cdn2.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/charm-188x300.webp 188w, https://2f5f93.p3cdn2.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/charm.webp 640w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />Uncommon Charm</em></a>, by Emily Bergslien and <a href="https://kathrynmweaver.com/">Kat Weaver</a>, lives up to its name. The frothy period piece, set in a magic-wielding alternate 1920’s London, charmed this reviewer, though it’s a hard story to classify. It’s part alternate history, part comedy of manners, part magical treatise, and part family mystery, all tied together by chatty, vivacious narration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The story is told by Julia, the charming and frivolous 16 year old daughter of Lady Aloysia Stirling, one of the most notorious wizards in 1920’s London. Julia has just been expelled from the Marable School for Girls when Simon Wolf arrives, to study magical with Lady Aloysia. Simon is serious, anxious, and also the illegitimate son of a close family friend, Prince Vladimir. The two become fast friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Julia and Simon stumble upon a </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">painful </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">secret </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">from</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> her mother’</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s past</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, and have to sort through what it all means. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he main thrust is not about solving </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> mystery, so much as understanding it, and integrating </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the way in which</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> this new knowledge affects their understanding of the people involved. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This leads to some exceedingly heavy revelations, though, so be prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Julia’s relationships form the backbone of this book. Her growing friendship with Simon starts the story, and also serves as the catalyst for the plot. Their differing personalities – he quiet, shy, and serious, and she talkative, frivolous, and clever – complement each other, and each brings out the best </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">in the other</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Over the course of the story, both Julia and Simon come into themselves. Simon </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">learns</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> to trust his magic, and grow</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> in confidence, while Julia comes to better understand </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">her mother,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> the upper-class society she lives in, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and who she truly wishes to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">In contrast, Julia and her mother get on each other’s nerves. Lady Aloysia is neurotic, reclusive, and eccentric as only the wealthy can be (she also read as potentially neuroatypical to me, though I don’t know </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">w</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">hat the authors intended). She </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is outwardly patient with her flighty daughter, but Julia smarts from the disapproval she senses under the surface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">M</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">agic </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">forms much of the backdrop of this story. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">There is no </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">firm</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> system, and in fact, most of the conversation between Lady Aloysia and Simon revolve around the fact that magic is undefinable, nearly ineffable. She is constantly prodding her pupil to examine his own experiences, to figure out what is true for him, and then to act on it. It’s a refreshing change from novels that rely on strict formulas for magic, with clearly defined cause and effect, energy and cost, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and contributes to the intellectual tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">A quick shout-out to the deft portrayal of Judaism. Simon is a young man of great faith, and his Jewishness subtly influences everything he does, without ever becoming his entire character. In particular, the way that his faith influences and defines his use of magic is fascinating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">My only criticism of this book is that it can be </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">so</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> subtle as to cross the line into vagueness. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I struggled to keep</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> track of what </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">wa</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s happening, and of what Julia and Simon ha</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">d</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> discovered, because nobody ever talk</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ed</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> about it directly. This is probably true to </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">life</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, but it ma</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">de</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> the story hard to follow at times. I couldn’t fully piece it together until I read it the second time. For</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">unately, Julia’s narration and the charming cast of characters made that a pleasure, rather than a chore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">All in all, <em>Uncommon Charm </em></span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">delivers a refreshing story with a solid core. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Though the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">novella</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> does explore some dark past events, I still found this to be a delightful palette cleanser between heavier books. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This is a strong choice for anybody who enjoys a blending of roaring 20’s high society and magic.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Octavia Cade is not the first author to tackle the looming specter of climate change,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><a href="https://ojcade.com/">Octavia Cade</a><a href="https://ojcade.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-27841 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/grief-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/grief-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/grief.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a> is not the first author to tackle the looming specter of climate change, but <a href="https://www.stelliform.press/index.php/octavia-cade-impossible-resurrection-of-grief/"><i>The Impossible Resurrection of Grief</i></a> still manages to find a unique niche in that landscape. In a world of sometimes strident diatribes, Cade crafts a eulogy. This isn’t a fire and brimstone preacher demanding that you repent. It’s a friend taking your hands in their own, looking you straight in the eye and saying, “yes, I see it, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>The Impossible Resurrection of Grief</i> takes place in the near future, in a time when species and ecosystems that are now critically threatened have finally succumbed. In the wake of this loss, people have begun suffering from the Grief – an all-consuming fixation on what the world has lost, which always ends in suicide. When our narrator, Ruby, loses her best friend to the Grief, she is drawn into a web of secrets and manipulations that pulls her from Australia to Tasmania and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I found the first chapter a little confusing, as it is not told in chronological order, but </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the novella</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> quickly settles </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">in</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">to a straightforward narrative. The suspense comes from the mystery that Ruby must unravel, and from her own ruminations. This is a very internal book, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and a lot of the forward momentum comes from Ruby’s growing understanding of the Grief, of herself, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and of humanity as a whole. What does it say about us, that we can watch so many species die, yet do nothing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Cade describes Ruby’s questions and her suffering </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">beautifully</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, not to mention the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">detailed observations of the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">world around her. I think that is part of why the book works – the themes are dark, but the writing is so gorgeous that it provides something of a protective balm. It makes the pain bearable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The ending feels inevitable, but also</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> somewhat incomplete. Cade carries the reader through an emotional journey</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">but I finished the book still unclear on </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">exactly </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">what the people behind the mysteries wanted from Ruby. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Or perhaps I’m just not smart enough to see it. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Thematically, the ending is perfect, and I can see why a book about such a weighty topic could not wrap everything up in a bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This is not </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">comfortable</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> reading. But </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I never felt like it was wallowing in sorrow, so much as revealing </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">thoughts and feelings that I normally </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">turn away from</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">here is a catharsis to reading a narrative that speaks aloud the deepest fears and knowings of a bruised heart. I found this novella to be more bracing than </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">depress</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ing, but of course that is a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> individual line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I doubt that any story could convince somebody to care about climate change, and I don’t think that was Cade’s intention. However, if you would like a book to help you sit with the sadness you already feel, I believe that <i>The Impossible Resurrection of Grief</i> will serve you well.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[People love haunted houses, the grander the better. That fear becomes all the more delicious&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">People love haunted houses, the grander the better. That fear becomes all the more delicious when it is bound to family legacy, when the house in question is an ancestral estate. <a href="https://www.neonhemlock.com/books/the-secret-skin"><em>The Secret Skin</em></a>, a gothic tale by <a href="https://winniewoohoo.com/">Wendy N. Wagner</a> and set in Prohibition era Oregon, is an excellent example of the genre. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-27362 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/56559011._SY475_-188x300.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/56559011._SY475_-188x300.jpg 188w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/56559011._SY475_.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />Storm Break was completed the day that June Vogel was born, but it was never a happy home – </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">for her, or for anyone else. Her mother – a grand lady, obsessed with entertaining –</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">had no time for a shy, homely daughter. June</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> left </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">to become an art teacher at a boarding school</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> as soon as </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he could, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> even found some measure of happiness </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">for six years</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">.</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> But now her brother, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Franklin,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> has asked her to return </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">for the summer. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">He needs her</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> to look after her niece, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Abigail,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> while he honeymoons with Lillian, his new wife, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and June can’t tell him no</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">As she slowly gets to know her niece – and later, Lillian herself – her presence awakens the house, and she uncovers secrets. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he Se</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">cret</span></em><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><em> Skin</em> has everything </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">you could want from</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> a gothic </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">style</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">novel</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> – an imposing and forbidding estate, the continued impact of an overbearing mother (now deceased), a half-feral child, a hateful housekeeper who clings to the memory of her deceased mistress, a forbidden</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> queer romance</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">endless</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> family shame and secrets. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Richly detailed, atmospheric writing bring</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> it all together for some delicious dread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">h</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is story beautifully demonstrates the insidious trap of</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> societal expectations and pressures. Frederick has inherited his father’s business and estate, but has no real interest or skill for either. His new wife, Lillian, struggles to play the role of the fancy lady, and copes with both that and other trauma through the use of opium. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Abigail, a nine year old wild child, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">sees the rot at the center of all of this, but has </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">little</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> power to do anything about it</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">June, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">who always </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">chafed against the role she was born into, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">only</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> character who has successfully escaped. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Now that she is back home she struggles to play the part of the lady of the house, and keeps slipping back into childhood habits of silent observation and obedience. </span>None of them can live as themselves, as Storm Break &#8212; its expectations and its demands &#8212; threatens to consume them all.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">While I loved the social dynamics and the lush atm</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">os</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">phere, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">here are several intriguing plot threads that are not developed as fully as I wanted. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Wagner introduces compelling characters in Frederick’s foreman and a Black truck driver whom he bullies, but they only tangentially connect to the main plot. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Of course, there is only so much space in a novella, but it was frustrating to get these tantalizing glimpses and then have very little come of them</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Still, the atmospheric writing and compelling characters made for an enjoyable reading experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">In the end, June chooses to leave Storm Break and its malevolence behind her. I think that f</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ans of </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">both </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Shirley Jackson and the gothic genre </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">will love </span><em><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The Secret Skin</span></em><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, but </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">it will also appeal to </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">those</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> who </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">have needed to make peace with their past, in order to build a future.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Two of my favorite books of the past few years were written by Alix E.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-26921 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/spindle-189x300.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/spindle-189x300.jpg 189w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/spindle.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" />Two of my favorite books of the past few years were written by <a href="https://alixeharrow.wixsite.com/author">Alix E. Harrow</a>, so when I saw that she had a novella out, I put in a request at my library without even checking what it was about. Imagine my elation when I discovered that <a href="https://publishing.tor.com/aspindlesplintered-alixeharrow/9781250765352/"><i>A Spindle Splintered</i></a> is a postmodern, thoroughly meta exploration of a fairy tale, combining two my favorite story types into one package!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">S</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">leeping </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">B</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">eauty is </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a bit problematic, especially in the Disney version</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> – the princess is too passive, the story line too patriarchal </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">(not to mention</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> centered on a kiss that could never be consensual</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">)</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. But it has a special place in our narrator’s heart, because she, too, has lived her life under the weight of a curse – an incurable genetic disorder that will kill her before her twenty second birthday. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">In Sleeping Beauty, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Zinnia Gray s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ees</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">“</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">[her]</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> own shitty story made mythic and grand and beautiful. A princess cursed at birth. A sleep that never ends. A dying girl who refused to die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">On her twenty</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> first birthday, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">her best friend</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> throws her a Sleeping Beauty-themed party in the guard tower of an abandoned prison, complete with a profusion of roses, tacky rhinestone crowns, and an honest to god spinning wheel. Of course, Zinnia </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">pricks</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> her finger on the spindle.</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> That’s when Zinnia is whisked away to a fairy tale kingdom </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> meet</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Princess Primrose of Perceforest,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> who </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">suffers from</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> the traditional </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">S</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">leeping </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">B</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">eauty curse. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Th</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">at’s when</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">fun really starts</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Zinnia’s acerbic wit and understanding of fairy tale tropes and history makes her a delightful</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> person to spend a few hours with. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">While she is – in her own words – a dying girl, who follows what she has defined as “the dying girl rules,” this book is also a lot of fun. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The narra</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">tion</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">spends plenty of time </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">poking fun </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">of fairy tale tropes, and the plot itself explodes those tropes from the inside. If you enjoy meta analysis, you’ll have a blast, but if that kind of self-aware commentary isn’t your thing, this might not be the book for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I can not say how well this story depicts life with a congenital, fatal disease like Generalized Roseville Malady. From where I’m sitting, it feels like a nuanced, balanced, and realistic depiction. The disease colors every part of Zinnia’s life, but it’s also not the full extent of who she is. Her struggle</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> with friendships and with her parents&#8217; grief felt realistic, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">but this may hit differently if you or a loved one </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">suffers from a serious illness. While Generalized Roseville Malady is fictional, it obviously </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">shares</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> similar</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ity with</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> many real conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">A</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">t the end of the day,</span><i> </i><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>A Spindle Splintered</i></span><i> </i><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">isn’t </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">only</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> a story about illness. It’s also about deciding to live fully, accepting other peopl</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">e</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">’s love, and how to make love a key, rather than a cage. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">If that sounds like your kind of thing, and you enjoy fractured fairy tales and self-referential humor, this is definitely a novella worth checking out.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a monk living on a solarpunk moon left the city on&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-26557 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psalm-188x300.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psalm-188x300.jpg 188w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psalm.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />Once upon a time, a monk </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">living on a solarpunk moon</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">left</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> the city on a quest to hear crickets. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Sibling Dex leaves their post as a gardener and takes up the life of a tea monk, traveling through the small towns bringing comfort to all they meet. </span><a href="https://publishing.tor.com/apsalmforthewildbuilt-dbtmp1203370/9781250236210/"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</i></span></a><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, by <a href="https://www.otherscribbles.com/">Becky Chambers</a>, is a touching exploration of purpose, relationships, humanity, and the keening ache for something out of reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Dex is an amazingly relatable protagonist. I realize that is </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> cliche, but in this case, it’s absolutely true. Their yearning for something more, their moments of intense embar</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">r</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">assment, the way they freeze up when they don’t know what to do – I saw myself in them. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I, too, have been dissatisfied despite living a life that </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">looks</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> good from the outside. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Many people have experienced that sort of existential angst</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Sibling Dex’s</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> problems are </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">my</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> problems, set in a fantastical world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">And what a world it is! Sibling Dex lives on a moon, Panga. It’s been two hundred years since the Age of Factories, when the robots woke up and left humanity behind. Since then, humans have built a new, more sustainable society: a solarpunk near-utopia where the environment is respected, nobody goes hungry, and solar, wind, and water provide all the power they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The early part of the book focuses on Sibling Dex and their situation, but </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the story</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> really comes alive when they are met by an unexpected visitor – a robot called Mosscap. Their conversations are at turns humorous and philosophical, a series of fumbling but well-intentioned attempts t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">o</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> bridge the gap between their experiences. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Dex has a lot of preconceived notions about robots, which leads to some hilarious misunderstandings. Mosscap’s gentle corrections are always firm, without ever suggesting that Dex was speaking with bad intent. Dex, in turn, accepts Mosscap’s corrections with grace. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This is the kind of healthy interaction I love to see modeled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">A</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s you may have gathered, the stakes </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">in this book </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">are not high. There is no life or death conflict, no great evil to defeat or destiny to achieve. Personally, I cherished this philosophical, conversational journey into meaning, but if you are in the market for something more </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">fast-paced</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, then I recommend that you look elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">The ending is as sweet and tender as the rest of the book, which won’t be a surprise to anyone familiar with the author’s other work. Your heart is always in good hands with Becky Chambers. There are no easy answers (I don’t think I would be recommending this book if there were!), but there is a lot of hope, not to mention plenty of plot threads for the upcoming sequel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Nearly two years into a pandemic, with the holiday season </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">in full swing</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, many of us need something grounding, something comforting that will tell us that we’re okay, that the world can be safe and good. This little book could be that something.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-26078 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/58130437._SY475_-188x300.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/58130437._SY475_-188x300.jpg 188w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/58130437._SY475_.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />A dead girl who doesn’t stay dead, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> house of luxury courtesans, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> world in which anyone without a job is fair game to be culled: </span><a href="https://www.neonhemlock.com/books/and-what-can-we-offer-you-tonight"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>And What Can We Offer You Tonight</i></span></a><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, by <a href="https://www.premeemohamed.com/">Premee Mohamed</a>, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">serves up</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> all of that and more. This atmospheric novella </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">is</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> a meditation on human worth in a world where only the rich are seen as people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Jewel is grateful to work at House Bicchieri, one of the classiest and mo</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">st</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> expensive brothels in the city. She has a roof over her head, food to eat, and a job that keeps her </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">alive</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. Does she realize that the world is massively unfair, that she and her fellow courtesans are being taken advantage of? Of course she does. But that’s just the way the world works, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and she knows there is no point in questioning it</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">W</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">hen </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">her friend,</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> Winfield, wakes up at her own funeral, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Jewel responds with surprising equanimity</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. She’s more concerned about where her fellow courtesan is going to stay, now that her room has reassigned to another (living) person, than about the fact that </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">she</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> has returned from death. Then Winfield decides that she is going to find the man who murdered her, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and Jewel’s world begins to slide out of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Some people might think that Winfield is the more natural protagonist – she, after all, is the one who rises from death, who stalks the city taking down rapists, murderers, and bullies. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">That makes for</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> a very a good story, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">b</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ut it’s one we have seen many times before. Instead, Jewel gives us the inner turmoil of the reluctant, the well-behaved, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the responsible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">M</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ohamed’s use of language took my breath away. It’s lyrical and dense, conjuring an almost dreamlike state at times. But it also captures Jewel’s anxieties </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">when necessary</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, breaking apart into fragments that evoke the gasping stutter of pure panic. Her struggle becomes our struggle. She wants to protect her friend, but she also wants to keep her job, to remain safe and alive (something that Winfield no longer has to worry about). The balance between survival and dignity is at the heart of this story, and the narrative never lets us forget it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he resolution strikes a balance between hope and realism, allowing us to imagine a better future for the characters. It doesn’t tie anything up in a perfect bow, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">which is an excellent choice;</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> this story is too emotionally raw for that to feel satisfying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">his moody dystopia isn’t afraid to linger over tough questions and internal quand</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ries, without ever feeling stuck. I was enthralled by Jewel’s story and her world from start to finish, and I think you will be, too. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">If you enjoy beautiful language, languid story telling, and character driven plots, check out </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>And What Can We Offer You Tonight,</i></span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> by </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Premee Mohamed.</span></p>

Add a heartbroken </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">retail worker</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">, her non-binary ex, and a customer whose grandmother wandered through a wormhole into another reality. Stir in a healthy dose of anti-capitalist sentiment, and you’d have <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250245724"><em>Finna</em></a>, by <a href="https://ninocipri.com/">Nino Cipri</a>. A</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">va is just trying to get through another day at her soul-crushing job at LitenV</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ä</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">rld, but fate and wormholes both have other plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">First of all, the set-up for this story is dark comedy gold. Nobody who has ever set foot in </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a huge furniture store</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> would be surprised to find a wormhole to another dimension there. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">As Ava and Jules travel through the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">maskh</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">å</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">l</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> (that’s Swedish for “wormholes,” at least according to their boss), they encounter threats ranging from the hilarious wingback fly trap, to a thematically on-point hive mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Cipri does an amazing job of capturing the exact agony of a soul-crushing corporate retail job, from the bland co-workers to the chipper boss pretending that you’re all a big family, or that corporate policy has a heart. It’s the kind of humor that makes you laugh as it cuts you. Every paragraph oozes anti-capitalist undertones, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">without being overbearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Under the humor and politics lurk </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">deeply human characters. Ava and Jules are among the most believable, nuanced characters I’ve ever met, and the way that each of their neuroses play off of the other’s is just so, so perfect. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Ava’s anxiety and Jules’s insecurity, her strong emotions and need for control versus their wanderlust and need to be seen as competent, painted such a vivid picture of two beautiful, whole people. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Much of the emotional story arc is about the t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">he fact that they still care about</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> each other in the wake of the break-up, and it’s honestly a breath of fresh air. Here are t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">w</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">o people who care deeply about each other, but who are truly better off as friends than lovers. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">That is something worth savoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">I</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n the end, <em>Finna</em> tells us that life is short, connection is worth fighting for, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and retail work sucks</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">These are messages that bear repeating, in a voice that is worth listening to. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">This energetic, anti-capitalist adventure is a perfect book for anybody who is feeling stuck, or who is just fed up with the modern world. </span></p>

Gibson</a> makes the character new in </span><a href="https://www.nyxpublishing.com/shop/a-dowry-of-blood-by-s-t-gibson/"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>A Dowry of Blood</i></span></a><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. Told from the point of view of his bride, Constanta, she gives us a view of the old vampire that is both fresh and familiar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">W</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">hat all good vampires – whether Dracula or not – have in common is a sense of </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">subvers</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ive</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Vampires have stood in for</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> much, fr</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">om </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">societ</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">y’</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">s fears around disease </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">the aristocracy, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">to the simple concept of</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> female sexual autonomy. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><i>A Dowry of Blood</i></span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> pays homage to each and every one of these, and adds some new forms of subversion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">First, let’s talk about sex. Dracula has often had a harem of wives, but Gibson puts him at the center of a fully fledged poly marriage that eventually expands from Constanta to include a second wom</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">a</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n and a young man. T</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">hese additions</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> are not just there for their dark lord’s pleasure, but take great pleasure in one another, as well. Nowhere is Constanta’s narration more sensual than when she is with Magdelana, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">and her descriptions of Alexi are at turns tender and appreciative of his abundant charms. There are just enough sex scenes to make the state of affairs clear – and enjoyable! – without ever feeling tawdry or self-indulgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">But t</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">his Dracula is not one of your sexy, brooding vampires. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">He</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> is a monster out of darkest nightmare, </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">n</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ot because he drinks blood and leaves corpses in his wake, but because of the way he treats his spouses. He is a monster, not in the way of the Hollywood legend, but in the way of so many mortals. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">He is manipulative and emotionally abusive, preventing his wives from having contact with the outside world or any sort of freedom. Constanta’s descriptions of that claustroph</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ob</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">ic life left me gasping for breath more than once. It’s a tribute to Gibson’s art that she is able to show that nauseating behavior side by side with Constanta’s frank adoration of him, without letting either cancel the other out. The discomfort of that dichotomy haunts the novella, right up until the catharsis of the ending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">But like every story, this is ultimately about people, not monsters. We get to enjoy a sweeping view of<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-25181 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920-250x300.jpg 250w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920-854x1024.jpg 854w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920-768x920.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920-1282x1536.jpg 1282w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vampire-2783034_1920.jpg 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /> European history through Constanta’s eyes</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">.</span> <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">We see war and plague and revolution, and in the end, that changing world manages to change our trio of </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">consorts</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> enough to break free from Dracula’s hold over them. </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Or rather, the</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">y</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> change each other. Constanta’s love for them – particularly, her tender affection for Alexi – finally motivates her to </span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">break free from her husband’s hold</span><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"> when she could never have done that for herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">Even the structure of this novella is subversive. It reveals the ending at the very beginning, seemingly removing any sense of suspense. But instead, my desire to find out exactly how the ending came to be – how Dracula met his demise at the hands of his wife, Constanta – kept me riveted. It’s a powerful story, told through rich, lyrical prose. The catharsis of the ending is both well-earned and realistically tempered, and I think it will resonate for anyone who has felt trapped by circumstances too powerful for them to control.</span></p>
