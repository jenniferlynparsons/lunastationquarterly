					<description><![CDATA[In the past few years, I’ve noticed increasing criticism lodged against one particular character trope:&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/anthony-intraversato-455600-unsplash.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-11991 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/anthony-intraversato-455600-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>In the past few years, I’ve noticed increasing criticism lodged against one particular character trope: the </span><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chosen one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sometimes referred to scathingly as “special snowflakes,” these characters usually don’t have individual merit (or, in some cases, very well-developed personalities), but rather a Grand, Prophetic Destiny, which positions them—often through the endowment of unique or extraordinarily strong gifts—as The Only One Who Can Save Us. Fans of any major franchise (think </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) will recognize this immediately: this idea of a chosen one taps strongly into the sort of hero mythology Joseph Campbell famously wrote about in his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hero With a Thousand Faces</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What’s curious to me, however, is that many fans of YA are turning against it—rejecting everything from the notion of a hero whose status comes randomly assigned, to the concept of a hero itself. (Not coincidentally, I’ve noticed a lot of books with gray or antiheroes have spiked in popularity in the past few years—<a href="https://www.juliedao.com/forestofathousandlanterns/">Julie C. Dao’s </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest of a Thousand Lanterns</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://www.hypable.com/conquerors-saga-historical-facts/">Kiersten White’s <em>The Conqueror’s Saga</em> </a>trilogy are good ones.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading arguments in favor of abolishing the special snowflake—in favor, presumably, of more realistic, ordinary characters who achieve greatness through their own merit—immediately put me in mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_series">John Marsden’s <em>Tomorrow</em> series</a>. The seven books, published between 1993 and 1999, were and are a massive hit in Australia; in 2018 it is considered a classic, and has been adapted both as a film and a television miniseries. And while it’s never achieved the same popularity in America, my local library did have a copy of the first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow, When the War Began</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the familiar story it contained—teenagers bravely facing the unthinkable—left a huge impression on me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow, When the War Began</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centers on Ellie, a teenager living in the rural outskirts of the small Australian town of Wirrawee. On a whim, she and her best friend Corrie decide to invite several of their other friends to go camping with them for a week out in the bush, in a remote, enclosed area known by the local farmers as “Hell.” They return home after a week to discover the unthinkable: their homes and farms abandoned, their animals dying, and the local showground turned into a prison camp—for their families, friends, and neighbors. In just the time they were away, Australia has been invaded by colonizing forces from Asia—and the seven teenagers are suddenly the only free people left in Wirrawee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With very little else to do in this unthinkable new world, the kids reluctantly decide to fight back—and in one fell swoop, Ellie is thrust from her role as trip organizer into that of guerilla leader. Ellie is smart and resourceful, but also by her own <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/denis-cardoso-1080389-unsplash.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-11992 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/denis-cardoso-1080389-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>admission hotheaded and pushy; she knows how to survive in and navigate the bush thanks to her rural upbringing, but has no other practical experience with which to fight a sophisticated invading army. And despite her courageous, almost instinctive assumption of leadership, Marsden reminds us painfully that she’s still a child: she wants to gossip with her best friend Corrie about who’s dating whom, and flirt with fellow fugitive Lee. On multiple occasions, she expresses a wish that there were simply adults present to take charge, and to remove the burden from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marsden does a brilliant job conveying the emotional battlefield of a war zone through his teenage cast of characters: the boredom, the hopelessness, the reckless bravado, the fear and concerns of dehumanization as impossible circumstances push Ellie and her friends to unthinkable acts. The triumph of the series is that, despite her grim surroundings, Ellie succeeds—not every time, and not without cost, but through a combination of street smarts, quick thinking, and often as not, sheer dumb luck. Her fallibility, her penchant to make dumb mistakes, and the limits of her knowledge make her one of the most realistic and well-crafted heroines I’ve ever encountered in young adult literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you love it or have grown to hate it, the Chosen One isn’t going anywhere—thousands of years in the zeitgeist have proved that much. But I think often of Ellie and her friends, and how interesting young adult literature would be with more characters like them: ordinary kids using nothing more than their smarts and each other to conquer incredible circumstances. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Something exciting happened to me this year: I started a work experience at Pan Macmillan&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/terricks-noah-667076-unsplash.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-11235 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/terricks-noah-667076-unsplash-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Something exciting happened to me this year: I started a work experience at </span><a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan Macmillan Australia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the publishers of obscure little novels like </span><a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781742613314/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Book Thief</span></i> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781760552596/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Little Lies</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Which means I have also officially become one of Those People: the ones you see on Goodreads reviewing books that won’t come out for months, who make you shake your head and think, “Dang, maybe </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should start a YouTube channel about books, funnel hundreds of dollars into high-quality VR equipment, and painstakingly gather a large enough base of subscribers so that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishers will send me ARCs too!?!?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky for me, I got to bypass all that by virtue of doing free proofreading. And even more luckily, I got an early copy, back in February, of one of the most remarkable books of 2018: the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and deservingly) highly-touted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children of Blood and Bone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a debut novel by author Tomi Adeyemi. It’s an </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/children-of-blood-and-bone-tomi-adeyemi/554060/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afrofuturist fantasy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s been favorably compared to </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tomi-adeyemi-children-of-blood-and-bone_us_5af5d71ae4b032b10bfa735f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Panther</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Black Lives Matter movement partially inspired it, and before its release in March, it had already been optioned for a film. Even in the world of young adult publishing, which is absolutely saturated with epic, cinematic titles made popular by precursors like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunger Games</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this novel stands out. Add a gorgeous and unique fantasy world, a heavy dash of West African mythology, and a smart, strong, hot-tempered heroine, and you have all the makings of something truly remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And remarkable is a good place to start when talking about our heroine, Zélie. Zélie lives in a world that has lost its magic—a commodity once wielded by people called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who were blessed at birth by the gods. The corrupt King Saran has used the inexplicable loss of magic to his advantage, murdering and enslaving the maji—including Zélie’s mother, whom she saw hanged in front of her by the king’s men. Zélie, along with her father and brother, struggle to survive in this world, finding themselves increasingly crippled by rising taxes and the threat of discovery: for Zélie is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">divîner</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who will never come into her powers now that magic has left the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traumas of Zélie’s childhood and the looming specter of the evil king have shaped her into a whipsmart teenager <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/samantha-qeja-551289-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-11236 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/samantha-qeja-551289-unsplash-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>hell-bent on survival. But they’ve also infused her with an all-consuming, unapologetic rage: she wants the men who killed her mother to pay for their crimes. This anger is tempered by her carefully learned survival skills, but not perfectly so. Her quick temper, snap judgements, and failure to listen to others’ advice land her into trouble on multiple occasions, and it’s incredibly rewarding to see a main character be so realistically flawed—and to see her grow and learn from her mistakes as the novel progresses. Equally rewarding is the relationship that grows between Zélie and secondary female character Amari: a foil to Zélie’s hardened street-smarts, she’s a sheltered princess with no true concept of the world beyond her palace walls. Female friendship is something I will never, ever be able to get enough of in young adult literature, and seeing these two drastically different characters progress from outright hostility to distrust to grudging respect and finally to friendship and protectiveness was one of my favorite parts to read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journey that Zélie undertakes—both in the grand scheme of the novel, with its gorgeous, magical worlds, and on a personal level—is a breath of fresh air in a market that feels over-saturated with the same type of fantasy heroine. I’m crossing my fingers that someone sends me an ARC of the sequel—I can’t wait to see where Zélie goes next.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[These days, girl power is ruling the market for children’s literature—and given the current sociopolitical&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, girl power is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the market for children’s literature—and given the current sociopolitical climate, it’s not hard to see why. Between the legacy of the Women’s March (which has itself been </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564143/the-pink-hat-by-andrew-joyner/9781524772260/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the subject of a picture book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the ongoing discomfort and uncertainty that comes with being a woman in Trump’s America, it’s become more <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jessica-podraza-524570-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-10920 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jessica-podraza-524570-unsplash-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a>imperative than ever that girls grow up strong and self-assured. For many, equipping young girls with tales of heroic women—like the explosively popular </span><a href="https://www.rebelgirls.co/products/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—has itself become an act of resistance. And it’s not a uniquely American phenomenon: since I moved to Australia in 2016, I’ve seen copies of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebel Girls</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creep into every household, obsessively given as gifts for birthdays and Christmas. In the children’s section of Dymocks, Australia’s major chain bookstore, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebel Girls </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and its dozens of spin-offs and imitations have swelled to dominate their very own multi-shelf section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he young adult reading level has seen a smaller influx of resistance-themed books, with titles like </span><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062748089/a-girls-guide-to-joining-the-resistance/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Girl’s Guide to Joining the Resistance</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-how-i-resist-ya-anthology-is-the-ultimate-resistance-guidebook-5501376"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How I Resist</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latter an anthology that boasts contributions from big YA authors like Libba Bray, Sabaa Tahir, and Malinda Lo. But my focus has always been on fiction, and lately, I’ve noticed the trend reflected there as well: a rising genre I like to call “Teen Girls Get Fed Up and Form Vigilante Girl Gangs to Knock Out Sexism at the Local Level.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of these novels came with </span><a href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/amy-poehlers-paper-kite-moxie-1201960075/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Poehler’s seal of approval </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(she also acquired film rights!) and an unapologetically livid black-and-pink cover, splashed with a call to arms for girls to rise up and fight back. </span><a href="http://www.jennifermathieu.com/my-books--moxie.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moxie</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="http://www.jennifermathieu.com/">Jennifer Mathieu</a>’s explosive fourth novel, draws inspiration heavily from the </span><a href="http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/music/The-History-of-Riot-Grrls-in-Music.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot Grrl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement, with its tone of sheer, unapologetic female anger pervasive throughout. However, it’s counterbalanced by the practicalities of being a teenager in high school: our heroine, Viv Carter, is miles away from fighting back against anything at the start of the novel. She’s your typical girl next door protagonist: she has a cool mom, kindly grandparents, and a best friend she’s known since kindergarten. Boys confuse her, and she’s counting down the days till college. But she’s also trapped in a hotbed of casual sexism that runs rampant at her high school, at best ignored and at worst abetted by teachers and staff. The novel does its subject matter a great service by making it clear that Viv’s high school is not “unusually” bad in this respect—only that Viv, who has grown up with the legacy of her mother’s former Riot Grrl days, is perhaps uniquely positioned to be bothered by it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Viv, by her own admission, is an unlikely candidate to actually do something about it. Already at a power disadvantage as a student, she holds no particular social clout, and considers herself too ordinary to be worth anyone’s attention. But when she finds a box of her mother’s old Riot Grrl things, including a series of feminist zines, she suddenly finds herself with an idea she cannot bear to dismiss. What follows is the creation of Moxie—a zine with a brutal, unapologetic tone that calls out the sexist policies of the school administration, starting with the unfair dress code. Viv herself is a one-woman printing press, creating and making copies of the zine before distributing them in the girls’ bathrooms. It’s thrilling and empowering to watch Viv grow in confidence as Moxie, initially a point of confusion and even discomfort for the other students at her high school, takes off and grows into a movement much bigger than just Viv herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brilliance of Viv as a heroine (and of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moxie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a whole) is that nothing about her is extraordinary. At no point does she become a leader in this movement. Throughout the course of the novel, we see her grow in confidence, but not in power: other girls, inspired and emboldened by the zines, begin to hold events and protests under the name Moxie, but Viv attends these as an observer, never revealing her involvement in Moxie whatsoever. When the truth does eventually come out, it’s less of a revelation as it is an opening for other girls to add their voices, with the bold claim that yes, Viv is Moxie, but they are Moxie, too. The message of the novel is also what it demands of each and every one of its readers: all it takes to enact change is an ordinary person with a bit of extraordinary courage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moxie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an angry rock and roller (best read to the music of Joan Jett), <a href="https://www.eringough.com/">Erin Gough</a>&#8216;s </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33296203-amelia-westlake#other_reviews"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amelia Westlake</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is her more<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/backlit-clouds-dark-862848.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-10919 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/backlit-clouds-dark-862848-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a> buttoned-up—but no less furious—little sister. Our heroines, an odd couple of fussy perfectionist Harriet Price and grungy troublemaker Will Everheart, are students at an ultra-elite private school, Rosemead Grammar. As with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moxie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s public American high school, Rosemead Grammar, with its state-of-the-art facilities and student body of future innovators, has a dark underbelly of sexism, elitism, and general disregard for its students: teachers play favorites with grades, money is funneled into grandiose, unnecessary projects, and the gym teacher leers at his teenage charges in the pool. While the students feel the effects of this corruption, they also feel the power and prestige associated with the Rosemead name, and their own powerlessness in the face of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Will and Harriet—and Amelia Westlake. As students, Will and Harriet exist at complete opposite sides of the spectrum: Will is a scholarship student and known troublemaker, known for her distaste of authority. Rosemead is designed to put people like her down, and she knows it; yet rising against it gets her into trouble time and time again. Harriet, meanwhile, comes from a place of wealth and privelege: a model student who benefits greatly from Rosemead’s system, and would rather ignore its “minor” problems than make any waves. But when their worlds collide, Harriet finds herself finally unable to look away from Rosemead’s problems, and agrees to help Will with a prank: a series of political cartoons, drawn by Will and written by Harriet, published in the school newspaper by a student named Amelia Westlake—a student who does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will and Harriet’s school responds initially to Amelia Westlake in much the same way as Viv’s classmates respond at first to Moxie. There is interest, and even agreement, but it fizzles out quickly. But by this point, something has begun that is not so easy to let die completely, and as Will and Harriet escalate with pranks that directly target the school—each using their particular skill sets and advantages—Amelia Westlake takes on mythic proportions, escalating into a movement. The message here, so similar to that of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moxie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seems to be that anyone can change the world: rich, poor, priveleged or not, everyone has something to bring to the table. All that’s required is a bit of courage—and, if you’re lucky, someone by your side who completes you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girl power is by now an old concept, but political contemporary YA is relatively new. It’s exciting to see the genre overtaken by female anger, female power, and ultimately, female triumph; and in this day and age, a reminder of the power of ordinary people is never misplaced. And as much as I hope that the anxiety of the current political regime is short-lived, I also hope that literary girl power is staying for a long, long time. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer: not a spoiler-free review. Trigger warning for sexual violence.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the qualities of a hero?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the question I kept returning to as I contemplated writing this review. Specifically, whether or not to write it at all. </span><a href="http://www.thebigthrill.org/2016/10/the-female-of-the-species-by-mindy-mcginnis/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Female of the Species</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had affected me deeply, with its savage commentary on rape culture, as well as the brutal way the characters reacted to it; it was certainly worthy of a glowing review. But the main character, Alex—a teenage girl who murders rapists—presented a problem. As a character I found her fascinating because her actions were morally dubious, with a strong suggestion that Alex herself was a sociopath. But was it responsible for me to dub her a hero? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christopher-sardegna-1735-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-10645 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christopher-sardegna-1735-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>What are the <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/heroism-a-discussion-for-discovery/">qualities of a hero</a>? Do we admire them more for the goodness that makes them larger than life, or in spite of the darkness that makes them so complicatedly human?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cast of supporting characters in Mindy McGinnis’s novel experience the same problem on how to perceive Alex—a girl who opens the book by knocking on the door of the man who raped and murdered her older sister. We aren’t shown what happens after the door clicks shut behind her, nor do we ever learn the specifics of what transpired there. But Alex is blunt and unrepentant even in her own thoughts: she tells us she knows how to kill someone and doesn’t feel bad about it. To her classmates, Alex is the sort of quiet girl who is easily forgotten, apart from her association with her murdered sister. But inside, Alex is completely consumed by violence: both the memory of what was done to her sister, and her obsessive quest to balance the scales with her own alarming brand of justice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of what the novel tells us about Alex is through the alternating perspectives of two characters who slowly become her friends: Peekay, who works with Alex at the animal shelter in town, and Jack, a popular jock with a crush on her. Peekay and Jack become involved with Alex at pivotal points in their own lives, where the culture of sexual violence they live in is beginning to reveal itself. Peekay has just been dumped by her boyfriend for a popular girl who “gets around”, while Jack, a genuinely well-intentioned teen obsessed with being a “good guy”, is slowly discovering, to his horror, that good intentions don’t make him less complicit in perpetuating rape culture. Both these characters are drawn to Alex for complicated reasons: Jack is infatuated with her, but also feels immense guilt for his involvement in the discovery of her sister’s body three years ago. Peekay is nervous of Alex’s strange, detached behavior, but her newfound helplessness in this world of slut-shaming and casual sexual violence draws her to Alex’s darkness, as well. And while neither of them are ever fully aware of the scope of what Alex is capable of, there’s an air of uneasy suspicion pervasive throughout their interactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex, meanwhile, is a character totally unique in the canon of young adult literature: completely, unflinchingly, and unrepentantly brutal in a way that is presented more complexly than simple strength. In a later chapter, upon discovering that a classmate’s uncle has molested a child, she instinctively moves to retaliate—against this man she does not personally know, in a horrific fashion, <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bruce-dixon-383618-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-10646 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bruce-dixon-383618-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>without so much as a second thought. Her obsession justice, and her perceived responsibility for enacting it where it has been denied, do not blind her to her own darkness: she knows that the calm, detached way she kills is indicative of something deeply wrong with her, and that she cannot stop it. The word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sociopath</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is never used but heavily implied. At the same time, however, it’s impressed upon the reader that Alex isn’t a monster: she’s a teenage girl who’s just beginning to move past the act of violence that turned her world upside-down. She makes a friend. She falls in love. She discovers, to her surprise, that she enjoys ordinary teenage things: school dances, sleepovers, talking to her friends about their crushes. It’s heartbreaking to see how close she comes to leaving the darkness behind, and how pervasive sexual violence is that it constantly drags her back in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So again, the question: what are the qualities of a hero? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Female of the Species</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is mum on the subject. It neither praises nor condemns Alex’s actions, preferring to let them speak for themselves: acts of violence spawned from unspeakable violence, a cycle that continues on and on and—inevitably—ends in tragedy. Yet by the end of the novel, Alex has left us with a glimmer of hope—a small inkling that the school’s pervasive rape culture may be dismantling, with other victims beginning to speak out, in small ways, against their attackers. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s hopeful, and for that, I argue that Alex, while flawed, may be the most realistic hero of all: an imperfect person capable of incredible darkness, whose legacy, nonetheless, is light. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to not judging a book by its cover, I’m generally pretty good.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/clark-young-135152-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-10409 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/clark-young-135152-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>When it comes to not judging a book by its cover, I’m generally pretty good. So when Balzer + Bray </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">released the cover of Justina Ireland’s novel </span><a href="http://justinaireland.com/dreadnation/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dread Nation</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last June, I was glad there’s no rule about having RIDICULOUSLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS based on a cover. With its gorgeous young model, confidently posed by an American flag with a bloody scythe in her hand, and a tagline seemingly referencing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below the title (Rise up!), I was completely sold before I even read the outline. To say that this was my most anticipated book of 2018 would not be a stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book I was actually presented with a year later did not meet those expectations. It sailed clean over them—more often than not in ways I never expected. What I thought I was getting, based on the cover and the outline, was a cool, action-packed book about a brave girl fighting zombies. What I actually got was much better: a thought-provoking, nuanced, gory, and thrilling novel that stayed with me long after I put it down.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dread Nation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a re-imagined history of post-Civil War America, in which the ghosts of this bloody and personal conflict are literal as well as metaphorical: following the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/07/the-battle-of-gettysburg-150-years-ago/100545/">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, the dead got up and started walking again. It’s a clever stage on which to mount the zombie apocalypse, which indeed, as the novel progresses, begins to feel only incidental to the story. The real evil, we discover, is much more sinister and cunning, as well as more familiar: politicians and leaders who cling to a dream of prewar America, an America that, incidentally, no longer exists. These leaders build walls around their cities, ostensibly to make them safe; they exploit people’s fear of zombies (“shamblers,” the novel calls them) to push forth their own racist agendas; they wish to create “a new America, one that embraces the promise of greatness.” This type of evil is all too recognizable, and—perhaps most frighteningly—does not require a zombie apocalypse to thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is in this unstable and terrifying world that we meet our protagonist, Jane McKeene, the daughter of a white <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/erda-estremera-36360-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-10410 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/erda-estremera-36360-unsplash-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>plantation owner’s wife and an unknown black field hand. Initially, Jane presents as a perfect, if typical, YA action heroine: she trains at a special combat school for black girls, where she is among the top students in her class; she has a rivalry with an uppity classmate and a complicated romance with a charming petty criminal. Her thoughts are frequently of her mother back home, and her predestined future—as personal guard to a high-society lady, in a “safe” city with minimal threat of actual shambler attack—frustrates her. It’s a story that feels familiar, and in a different sort of novel, Jane’s journey would be just as formulaic: beating her rival, winning her love interest, and being lauded far and wide for her heroics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, however, as the novel progresses, it becomes clear that this society is designed to prevent Jane’s story from being that simple. The combat school, we discover, is part of something called the Negro and Native Reeducation Act: these “second-class citizens” are considered more expendable for the protection of the country, and are forcibly put in such institutions from the time they are twelve. Another character in the book, who at eleven years old is on the brink of conscription, is strategically moved around in order to prevent her from such a fate. Following their training, these teenagers may become Attendents, which are glorified ladies’ maids with combat knowledge, or sent away to communities like Summerland—a walled community on the prairie where slavery is only technically illegal. Jane may be one of the best in her class, but she’s there against her will, and wants above all to return to her beloved home and her mother. It’s a horrifying, no-win situation, as well as a scathing commentary on the evolving nature of slavery in America, no more evident than in this exchange between Jane and a fellow indentured fighter:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Slavery is illegal,” I say. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not necessarily. They got loopholes in that there Thirteenth Amendment. . . lots of different ways to pretty up the same old evils.” </span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane as a YA heroine is a perfect balance of subverting tropes and celebrating them. She’s smart to the point of cold calculation at times, and knows how to play the system, yet she’s free with risk-taking as well. She’s completely bad ass in combat, stepping into natural leadership in the most awesome battle sequence </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the text emphasizes that she’s no “chosen one”: she’s making the best of a terrible situation same as anyone else. And while she’s shown to have compassion, particularly towards younger people, her attitude toward her enemies is ruthless to the point of other characters worrying there’s something wrong with her. Her relationships with these other characters are a strong point of the novel as well: her complicated but intensely loving relationship with her mentally unstable mother; her irritation-turned-tolerance-turned-genuine affection for her rival Katherine; her uneasy and maybe-romantic alliance with dangerous element Red Jack. Most importantly, she’s fiercely, fully aware of herself in a world that sees her as little more than cannon fodder—and refuses to conform to its expectations of her.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be patient, that lawman will get his just desserts.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His lips twist, filled with malice. “I ain’t yet seen the man who can do that.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe that’s your problem. You been waiting for a man.” </span></i></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to On Beyond Katniss, a column exclusively for the heroic young women of YA who face incredible odds, shatter expectations, and bring something new to a genre that’s already overflowing with amazing female characters.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bashar-alaeddin-436039.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-9582 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bashar-alaeddin-436039-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Every once in a while, I’ll read or see something that infuriates me so much it leaves an indelible impression. Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn’s book <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/books/08nussbaum.html"><em>Half the Sky</em></a> comes to mind as an example; the 2002 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252444/"><em>Rabbit-Proof Fence</em></a> is another. I remember after watching the latter, I called my mother in a helpless rage—I suppose because, in some childish way, I expected her to somehow make sense of the terrible things human beings do to one another.</p>
<p>Of course, these things are as inexplicable as they are cruel. But the reason these stories leave such an impression, I suspect, is that the more horrible the struggle, the more heroic are those who overcome it. <em>Half the Sky</em> is full of women who struggle up from a world literally designed to put them down. The three young Aboriginal girls in <em>Rabbit-Proof Fence</em> flee on foot from the government that stole them from their mothers. And in Fox Benwell’s novel <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/fox-benwell/kaleidoscope-song/"><em>Kaleidoscope Song</em></a>, we see a protagonist who, in the face of horrific violence and prejudice, quietly rebels against the status quo to try to make life better for herself and others like her.</p>
<p><em>Kaleidoscope Song</em> is set in modern-day South Africa—the “rainbow nation” of post-apartheid that, we gradually discover, still suffers from forms of prejudice that manifest themselves in terrifying ways. The book lures you in with a familiar-feeling story of a young girl—fifteen-year-old Neo—whose dreams are ill-matched to her parents’ expectations: Neo is obsessed with music, and longs to one day work for Umzi Radio, the local station that broadcasts to her hometown of Kayelitsha. Benwell uses lovely, poetic language to describe how deeply music entwines with the mundanities of Neo’s life: her boredom doing chores at her mother’s salon, her complicated relationship with her best friend, and her frustration that her parents do not see her music dreams as realistic. Her relationship to music, as both entertainment and escape, is deeply felt in every part of her life.</p>
<p>Neo’s love for music eventually compels her to sneak out to a bar where Umzi <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hans-vivek-176134.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-9583 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hans-vivek-176134-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a>Radio will broadcast live, and propels her into the lives of a band called Tale and the Storytellers, whose music moves her deeply, and whose lead singer, Tale, she immediately becomes infatuated with. The story slowly, tantalizingly leads you to the fact that this infatuation isn’t merely one of musical admiration: Neo is in love with Tale, and as she interacts more and more with Tale and the members of her band, it becomes clear that, while her feelings are reciprocated, she is entering into a larger and vastly more dangerous world—one that she does not fully comprehend.</p>
<p>[Spoiler alert below]</p>
<p>It’s Neo’s hopeful naïveté, juxtaposed with the hardened, fearful attitudes of Tale and her LGBT+ bandmates, that creates the starkest portrait of what it’s really like to be LGBT+ in this South African community. Those of us who have grown up in relatively LGBT-safe communities will surely identify with Neo: she longs to hold her girlfriend’s hand in public, is overjoyed by her very first Pride march, and takes a public stand for LGBT rights on her radio show. The rest of the band becomes frustrated with her lack of caution and her failure to comprehend their warnings, but a reader like me—who’s never had to fear for her life simply for being LGBT—can’t really understand it either. It’s why the horrific act of violence, toward the end of the book, packs such a terrifying punch: neither Neo, nor many of us in the audience, could ever have imagined this happening.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sharon-mccutcheon-516755.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-9584 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sharon-mccutcheon-516755-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" /></a>And while Benwell bravely tackles the issue of corrective rape—an issue which, according to a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11608361/Corrective-rape-The-homophobic-fallout-of-post-apartheid-South-Africa.html">2015 article in the <em>Telegraph</em></a>, is still pervasive in South Africa, with hate crimes based on sexual orientation not recognized by South African law—he does not simply leave his heroine there to flounder as a tragic story or a cautionary tale. Rather, he presents us with these terrible realities and has her rise up against them yet again. To tell you exactly how Neo stages her recovery would be to spoil the book’s incredibly triumphant end—a conclusion so brave and hopeful that it cemented this as one of my favorite novels of 2017. But rest assured, it’s worth slogging through all the pain for.</p>
<p><em>Kaleidoscope Song</em> is by no means a perfect book. I’ve become almost hypercritical of LGBT novels that focus on the pain of being gay or have unhappy endings, and the triggers this book contains are numerous and heavy. But ultimately I believe Neo’s strength and belief in the future—in the face of a terrifying reality—can, and should, be called heroic.</p>
