										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are going to be a lot of year-end wrap ups coming along soon and they&#8217;re all going to say one thing: 2016 was weird and the unexpected, both good and bad, was waiting around every corner. That&#8217;s a speculative fiction author&#8217;s bread and butter.</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re now so familiar with the unexpected, you&#8217;re ready for our great new collection of stories. They will also surprise you, though this time, I&#8217;m pleased to say, they&#8217;re is definitely nothing bad about any of them. Well, except maybe the villains, but then, that&#8217;s how things are meant to be, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>You might want to start with our featured story,&#8221;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/the-question-of-the-blade/">The Question of the Blade</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/author/alex-yuschik/">Alex Yuschik</a>Â and then go on reading the rest of the fabulous stories in this issue.</p>
<p>And if you like what you see there, spread the word and let someone else who loves great stories know about us. You can also support us by buying a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1938697812/">gorgeous print edition</a> or a digital edition in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>Happy reading!!!</p>
