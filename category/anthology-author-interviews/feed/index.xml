<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?</span></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a writer, part-time photographer, and full-time mother living in Louisville, KY. I&#8217;m rather obsessed with stories in all their forms, from magazine editorials to psychological case studies to the traditional short form. Currently, I&#8217;m loving polaroids from the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-6179 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Charlotte-Nash-Colour-High-Res_resized-199x300.jpg" alt="Portrait of Author Charlotte Nash" width="199" height="300" /></p>
<p><em>First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?</em></p>
<p>Super power is perhaps passing exams &#8230; I have degrees in engineering and medicine. I&#8217;m a former R&amp;D engineer, incident investigator, and current technical writer. That&#8217;s the boring CV stuff. On the exciting side, I love motorbikes, sailing, running, and anything that qualifies as going-on-adventures (Except for bungee jumping &#8211; I don&#8217;t do gravity-driven extreme sports).</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?</span></em></p>
<p>To be honest &#8230; I saw this movie called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887883/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Burn After Reading</em></a>, and towards the end &#8220;clusterfuck&#8221; appears in the dialogue. I hadn&#8217;t heard it before. I thought, fantastic &#8211; I want to use that in a story. So I started to imagine what sorts of situation might be described that way in sci-fi. I decided a spaceship captain, setting his craft to burn up on reentry qualified as a pretty bad sitch. Then I just had to write what had happened to put him there. The tone departed a bit from the inspiration, but that&#8217;s the truth of how it came about.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?</span></em></p>
<p>Sure do. I have a new novel, which is Australian rural fiction (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24810233-crystal-creek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crystal Creek</em></a>). It&#8217;s an awesome story (says me), but not quite the flavour of <em>LSQ</em>, though, so if you&#8217;re after sci-fi, check out <a href="http://fablecroft.com.au/publications/phantazein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantazein</a> and <a href="http://www.lynmcconchie.com/new/?p=1556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Only As Directed</a>, two anthologies that carried two of my works last year &#8211; both my stories were nominated for national Australian awards. As to working on &#8211; my current project is an agricultural cyberpunk novel, that I&#8217;m aiming to finish and sub before the end of the year.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?</span></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a simple Word/Excel user &#8211; Word for manuscripts, Excel for scene lists &#8211; plus notebooks. I have a laptop on my desk with external monitor/keyboard/mouse for use at home, and another computer I use for research (or distraction) alongside. I take the laptop with me if I&#8217;m working out of home. I sometimes use Freedom/AntiSocial (less needed after a baby cut my available time). Otherwise, I back up to an external harddrive and dropbox, but I don&#8217;t like things to live in the cloud. I don&#8217;t like writing to music, or use things like Scrivener &#8211; they are time wasters for me.</p>

<p><span data-sheets-value="[null,2,&quot;I wrote \&quot;Harvesting Wishes\&quot; when my daughter was two. We spent a lot of time in parks, sitting in the grass and picking dandelions.

This was also a time of big change and uncertainty -- we knew we were going to move after my husband got his PhD, but we didn't know where. So, I was thinking about the different possible paths my life could take -- would we move to Pittsburgh for three years and rent a big house with my sister? Would we end up in Texas or Michigan for the rest of my life? There were so many options, and I had mixed feelings about most of them. But I was trying to find peace with accepting whatever happened. So, at it's heart, \&quot;Harvesting Wishes\&quot; is about that -- grappling with desires in the face of uncertainty and looking for peace.

Furry fiction is basically fiction that features talking animals, and the stories in ROAR 6 range all over the place -- cats, dogs, weasels, horses, several types of birds, a gerbil, a dragon, and a werewolf to name a few. Some of the stories are what's called \&quot;secret life of animals,\&quot; where the animals are basically in the normal human world but we get to see what goes on when the humans aren't around. Some of the stories are fantasy or sci-fi, and then there are just some plain old furry stories where the characters are animals just because it's fun and colorful to have a cast of all different species. It was a really fun project to edit, and I hope that it helps introduce some new people to furry fiction who hadn't yet realized that it's a type of fiction they want in their lives.&quot;]" data-sheets-userformat="[null,null,513,[null,0],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,0]">I&#8217;ve been trudging my way through writing my fourth novelâ€”Otters In Space 3.
