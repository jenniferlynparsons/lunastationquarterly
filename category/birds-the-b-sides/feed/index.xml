					<description><![CDATA[Big Mess (September 9th, 2016) by Grouplove Among the vast selection of original shows Netflix&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(September 9th, 2016) by <a href="http://www.grouplovemusic.com/">Grouplove</a></span></p>
<p>Among the vast selection of original shows Netflix offers, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/">BoJack Horseman</a> </em>could count as the funniest, saddest and most relatable. From jokes about current events to heart-to-heart monologues, BoJack hits <em>hard</em>. In Season 1, Episode 3, a cynical ghost-writer Diane Nguyen, says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I believe in &#8216;deep down&#8217;. I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grouplove produced the ending for <em>BoJack</em> &#8212; several endings, actually. And maybe Diane&#8217;s message sunk in too deep.</p>
<p>Delivered in <span style="font-weight: 400;">2010, Grouplove&#8217;s self-titled EP displayed a vibrant, passion-powered mix of emotions &#8212; most notably &#8220;Naked Kids&#8221; and &#8220;Get Giddy&#8221;. It was the perfect set-up for a collaboration with BoJack Horseman, an equally funky (and depressing) cartoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years later, Grouplove has received a reserved seat in the international indie rock scene. Months and months of anticipation led up to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spurring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the start of a lengthy tour through Europe and the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grouplove is at the height of their popularity, but at what cost?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a gigantic change from earlier albums, and also a little bit of a mess. &#8220;Welcome To Your Life&#8221;, the records first and most popular song, presents a seemingly homogeneous blend of sounds, with less prominent bass than usual. It fits well into the catchy, radio-friendly alternative genre &#8212; consequently, it isn&#8217;t as powerfully unique as Grouplove&#8217;s earlier singles (think &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXHrfIZe484">Shark Attack</a>&#8220;).</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Grouplove - Welcome To Your Life [Official Video]" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ng8cDzyktEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s ironic, looking at Grouplove&#8217;s discography. They </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">were</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ones who popularized the term, &#8220;Never trust a happy song.&#8221; Now they&#8217;re all, &#8220;We&#8217;re back in business, you&#8217;re such a big mess / And I love you, yeah, I love you,&#8221; every fifteen seconds. Perhaps Grouplove has gone meta. Perhaps they&#8217;ve lost ties to their old philosophies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14-the-giver-gathering-blue-messenger-son.w750.h560.2x.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-7259 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14-the-giver-gathering-blue-messenger-son.w750.h560.2x-300x224.jpg" alt="14-the-giver-gathering-blue-messenger-son-w750-h560-2x" width="300" height="224" /></a>It&#8217;s not uncommon &#8212; the last time I felt so strongly about a discontinuation in quality was when I bought <em>Gathering Blue</em>, <em>Messenger</em> and <em>Son</em> in Lois Lowry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.loislowry.com/index.php?option=com_djcatalog2&amp;view=items&amp;cid=4:the-quartet&amp;cid=4:the-quartet&amp;Itemid=185"><em>The</em> <em>Giver</em> quartet</a>. Like a lot of people, I had to read <em>The Giver</em> for a middle school project. The thing is, I really liked it, and spent the rest of my life until 12th grade hoping for a sequel. Imagine my excitement when I found out there were <em>three</em>. </span></p>
<p>But they weren&#8217;t same. None of the sequels had the same creepy, something&#8217;s-not-right feeling <em>The Giver</em> gave me. They felt more like little additions to the original than individual books that could stand on their own.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely felt let down by <em>Big Mess</em> in the same way those sequels let me down. &#8220;Do You Love Someone&#8221; is similar to its predecessor, albeit more reminiscent of original Grouplove vibes. It still skates by with fresh distinctions of past tracks, like the two-minute electronic introduction to &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdB296pKdPI">I&#8217;m With You</a>&#8221; or the twisted guitar solos of &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgF9knPeReo">Borderlines and Aliens</a>&#8220;. And the lyrics are impenetrable and hard to feel, the opposite of a quality that once separated Grouplove from other ensembles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, &#8220;Standing In The Sun&#8221; evokes a familiar longing, tangled with sunny California sound (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gotta say it&#8217;s kinda hard to believe in something that&#8217;s missing that feeling / Find out how to be collected, put it in a box and send it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It&#8217;s the first song on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s a stretch from Grouplove&#8217;s typical melodies, but enjoyable and imaginative anyhow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, &#8220;Enlighten Me&#8221; is bland, even more so than &#8220;Welcome To Your Life&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t feel like Grouplove &#8212; perhaps it was inspired by more pop-ish artists. The thing is, as earlier records have shown, Grouplove should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, &#8220;Good Morning&#8221; is a lovely change. Hannah Hooper&#8217;s opening verses are unforgettably fun, and the chorus doesn&#8217;t disappoint. It&#8217;s comparable to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spreading Rumors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> glorious, upbeat hit, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGvHnDeS12o">Ways To Go</a>&#8220;. Subsequently, &#8220;Spinning&#8221; is a slower number that Grouplove demonstrates well. It shows off one of Grouplove&#8217;s key characteristics &#8212; expression of somber lines with joy (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here I am / Found my colors in the gray</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cannonball&#8221; is the album&#8217;s most energetic track, beginning with a really, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wonderful beat. My first thoughts were along the lines of, <em>Now this is a song I need to hear live</em>. &#8220;Traumatized&#8221; continues the line of dynamic compositions, with an opening reminiscent of &#8220;Horseshoes and Handgrenades&#8221; by Green Day. &#8220;Heart of Mine&#8221; isn&#8217;t as hard-hitting, but does boast a few strong basslines. <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/index-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-7269 size-full" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/index-1.jpg" alt="index" width="230" height="219" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Making It Happen&#8221; is the most relatable song on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re the one who got away, and I just can&#8217;t let go / How my mom keeps playing games, dropping in before I drop out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). I&#8217;m a bit obsessed with the pre-bridge lines too, (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the boys, come follow me, come follow me from NYC / And all the girls from the internet, in your private jets, getting wet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Indeed, the tenth track hits a sweet spot between fun and meaningful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hollywood&#8221; has an opening tune like &#8220;Shark Attack&#8221;, and is truly as great. To me, it draws a metaphorical parallel between Grouplove and other alternative bands (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood just talks the talk, making movies round the clock / But I got something classical, to keep the people wanting more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts on the wrong note, it certainly ends on the right one. The album could be a lot better &#8212; more than half of it isn&#8217;t of the quality I&#8217;d expect from Grouplove. Whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grouplovemusic.com/blog/note-sean-39336">the lack of Sean Gadd</a> or a possible desire for a new sound, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn&#8217;t as impressive as Grouplove&#8217;s previous releases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, I am heartbreakingly nostalgic about the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never Trust A Happy Song</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spreading Rumors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> days. Yet, for the sake of some seriously cool songs, like &#8220;Good Morning&#8221;, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Making It Happen&#8221; and &#8220;Hollywood&#8221;, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Mess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is worth a listen.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blush (August 5th, 2016) by Moose Blood Inspired by bands like Jimmy Eat World and&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><i>Blush </i>(August 5th, 2016) by <a href="http://mooseblooduk.com/">Moose Blood</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/moose-blood-blush.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-7035 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/moose-blood-blush-300x300.jpg" alt="moose-blood-blush" width="300" height="300" /></a>Inspired by bands like <a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/">Jimmy Eat World</a> and <a href="http://www.smashingpumpkinsnexus.com/">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, Moose Blood has grasped a distinguishable pop-punk voice that sits somewhere between <a href="http://www.thefrontbottoms.com/">The Front Bottoms</a> and <a href="http://realfriendsband.com/">Real Friends</a>. Combing through <em>I&#8217;ll Keep You In Mind, From Time to Time</em>, I wondered if Good Charlotte had gotten back together after a thorough classroom analysis on Man Overboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, the British quartet hails from the same label as New Found Glory, The Wonder Years, All Time Low and Neck Deep. Formed in Canterbury, Moose Blood continues the famous line of Warped Tour groups Hopeless Records has represented for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They do it well, for the most part. The August release of <em>Blush</em>, two years after a successful debut album, was highly anticipated by Moose Bloods faithful fanbase. Sweeter and more polished than previous records, <em>Blush</em> is an aestival LP as vibrant as its cover art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impressive beats are resonant from the beginning, spiked with glamorous solos. &#8220;Pastel&#8221; is a fun, catchy song, though not suspenseful enough for the album&#8217;s commencement. Still, it matches the color of <em>Blush</em>: enthusiastic, summery and fresh. The same cannot be said for the initiation of &#8220;Honey&#8221;. Nevertheless, a harmonious riff from Mark Osborne is the highlight of this hit single, spinning into the catchy chorus that won Moose Blood a Kerrang! nomination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, &#8220;Knuckles&#8221; starts with kick drum power and continues into bittersweet melody, like Pastel. Indeed, Moose Blood&#8217;s introverted drummer, Glenn Harvey, is far underappreciated. Ray Harkins 100 Words Or Less podcast with Harvey <a href="http://100wordspodcast.com/post/91251470579">reveals his love for hardcore music</a>, which connects with his lively, exuberant talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the albums weight is concentrated in &#8220;Sulk&#8221;, dressed with narrative about a troubled girl </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Don&#8217;t tell me it was so glamorous / Powdering your nose and getting undressed)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is where <em>Blush</em> smoothly twists from sunny to wistful. &#8220;Glow&#8221; and &#8220;Cheek&#8221; juxtapose pop-heavy openings with a solid solos and melancholic lines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I knew she was lying when she said you&#8217;re okay / You&#8217;re not okay, no, you&#8217;re not okay, are you?)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, falling into the darker side of the album.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a luminous melody and a relatable, precariously-written message </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I guess it&#8217;s time to write another one about being drunk, and I just sit outside with a smoke on / It&#8217;s too late, it&#8217;s too late, his jaws all over the place, and you know this one ain&#8217;t like the last one)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;Sway&#8221; shines bright within <em>Blush&#8217;</em>s sorrowful half. &#8220;Shimmer&#8221; and &#8220;Spring&#8221; are also rife with heart, both of the soft and somber category. They spark intensity in a unique way: Brewerton becomes vulnerable, releasing the same warmth and passion as popular bands that are known for it (e.g. Brand New).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spontaneous flare of pop-punk exertion in &#8220;Shimmer&#8221; is only foreshadowing to &#8220;Freckle&#8221;, <em>Blush&#8217;</em>s brokenhearted finale. It&#8217;s a fantastic ending, far superior to earlier transitions, such as Pastel to Honey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The single flaw in <em>Blush</em> is how easily it blends into its own background. While a few tracks are vivid with originality and emotion&#8211;most notably &#8220;Spring&#8221;, &#8220;Sway&#8221; and &#8220;Pastel&#8221;&#8211;others sound formulaic in terms of the pop-punk/emo scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s reminiscent of my thoughts on Judy Blume&#8217;s books &#8212; startling topics, boring plots. Edgy stories about wanting boobs and having girl gang meetings in treehouses sounded interesting &#8212; admittedly, to my ten-year-old self &#8212; but they weren&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps that was the point, for Blume &#8212; to show normality in words that strike the American public as taboo, when in reality are just elements of a female teenager&#8217;s life. Moose Blood&#8217;s canorous instrumentals call for deeper lyrics, verses that are main characters, not part of the scenery. This was achieved succinctly in their debut album, yet missed in <em>Blush</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Moose Blood&#8217;s hint of hardcore doesn&#8217;t hurt its liveliness factor. <em>Blush</em>, though in contrast to <em>I&#8217;ll Keep You In Mind, From Time to Time</em>, features a handful of conspicuous titles that&#8217;ll keep pop-punkers on their toes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And hopefully, there will be more to come.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Psychic Reader (July 17th, 2015) by the Bad Bad Hats Review In suburban Northwest Portland,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(July 17th, 2015) by the <a href="http://www.badbadhats.com/">Bad Bad Hats</a> Review</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In suburban Northwest Portland, life can feel like an eternal traffic jam &#8212; the musty mildew swarming over abandoned sidewalks, the unguarded, mid-December garage sales with icicles hanging over each window. West Portland is a world apart from the East side: its not gritty, grungy or hipster. Its middle-class haven, and forever stuck in the 90&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unshockingly, it&#8217;s an invitation for isolation. For my high-school self, most nights were spent in my polka-dotted bedroom, practicing the same three bass solos for talent shows nobody really attended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only a fifteen minute drive east, the big town, small city vibe is alive and thriving, glowing vibrantly in the form of sushi bar signs and strip clubs posing as family-friendly hotels. Throughout my youth, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to run into environmentally conscious craft stores that sold broken light bulbs, or food-cart monopolies on vegan junk food. Indeed, downtown Portland boasts a unique feeling that I thought couldn&#8217;t be mimicked anywhere, or, in anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, I have never been to Minneapolis, and I hadn&#8217;t heard of the band Bad Bad Hats until recently. Its been exactly one year since they made their debut album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I came across the record while scouring Spotify for that unmistakable West Portland teenager sound, a cross of emotional, acoustic indie tunes and toe-tapping pop-rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sunny trio (according to their website, Triforce), Kerry Alexander (vocals, guitar), Chris Hoge (drums) and Noah Boswell (bass) were signed to Afternoon Records in 2013, the year they released a bubbly EP called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Hurts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a successful follow-up, its fresh, mint-green cover featuring a silver waning crescent, fitting to the bands quirky yet ethereal sound.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, the album expresses the band&#8217;s eccentric energy. &#8220;Midway&#8221; sets the mood in a star-gazing kind of night, atmospheric with a steady beat. Kerry Alexanders vocals are soft and girly with a karate kick, somewhere in between Michelle Branch, Ryn Weaver and Vanessa Carlton. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bad Bad Hats - &quot;Midway&quot; (Official Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOUC6m82xEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shame&#8221; is unquestionably the most energetic of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the least fitting to the album. Its dramatic, electric guitar-filled introduction breaks into the album&#8217;s whimsical aura, and sounds strangely reminiscent of 2010&#8217;s forgettable pop-punk phase. Thankfully, it&#8217;s countered by a hilarious music video, and an incredible bass line build-up to the chorus in &#8220;Joseph&#8221;, where Alexander wistfully sings, &#8220;I want you to remember, I want you to forget about me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Psychic Reader&#8221; brings back the chimerical warmth of &#8220;Midway&#8221;, leading dramatically into &#8220;Fight Song&#8221;, a melody with more determination, less dreaming. A fierce, empowering movement is introduced in Things We Never Say as Alexander whispers, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t get you off my mind, babe, so I bought this dress to spite you / I&#8217;ll wear it cause I hate you, cause you don&#8217;t know what you got / Then I&#8217;ll wear it to your house and I&#8217;ll let you take it off.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued in &#8220;Cruella&#8221;, a speculation on unfaithfulness, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s message becomes stronger and increasingly independent. Alexander proclaims herself Cruella de Vil, an infamous, luxuriously-living woman widely known as a heartless bad-bitch. While the pieces don&#8217;t always fit musically, the theme is dynamic with just enough consistency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p2cbad.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-6851 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p2cbad-300x232.jpg" alt="p2cbad" width="300" height="232" /></a>It seems as though Alexander&#8217;s voice grows within </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our golden-blonde heroine in crimson sunglasses goes from pleading in &#8220;Joseph&#8221; to veering away from an unhealthy relationship in &#8220;Spin&#8221; (&#8220;Hey baby, I&#8217;ve been meaning to tell you / I don&#8217;t want to die for you&#8221;). &#8220;Say Nothing&#8221; incorporates catchy instrumentals into a frustrating topic: those lovers we chase who will never reciprocate how much we care for them (&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask where this is coming from / Don&#8217;t act like you&#8217;re the lonely one&#8221;).</span></p>
<p>In 2015, Alexander explained to <a href="http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/exclusive-album-stream-psychic-reader-bad-bad-hats/#_">Interview Magazine </a>her adoration for love songs. &#8220;I think this album is sort of focused on past relationships I&#8217;ve had and reminiscing about things that were, but are no longer,&#8221; she said. The narrative told in <em>Psychic Reader</em> is one of a young adult who is still fighting to understand how quickly emotions can come and go. Alexander, as its main character, skates through her experiences with more confidence in each chapter. As a reader &#8212; or, in this case, listener &#8212; I would categorize her as her own superhero.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychic Reader </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gracefully spins from cowering to dramatic, revealing the spectrum emotion romance can bring. At the same time, it fails to be cheesy. The Bad Bad Hats have wiggled their way into my list of favorite bands because they seem incapable of writing songs that are unrelatable. Instead, each track tells deep, reflective stories that should make you cry, but don&#8217;t. Because they&#8217;re too busy making you dance.</span></p>
