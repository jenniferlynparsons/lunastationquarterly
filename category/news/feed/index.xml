										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you hear their thundering hooves? Have you caught a glimpse of a long, spiral horn? If you have, you may have figured out that our December issue has a very powerful theme: Horses!</p>
<p>Horses loom large in our collective histories. Symbols of power, of strength, companions on a long journey, heroes, magical creatures, etc. they‚Äôre woven through the fabric of our tales.</p>
<p>All this love of horses is pouring out here and now, the obvious inspiration for this year‚Äôs theme. There‚Äôs such a wild and varied selection of stories in this issue, tales full of magic and mayhem, court intrigues and cybernetic mounts. And of course, a few unicorns for good measure. It‚Äôs nothing less than you might expect from a stories centered on a creature with such presence in the tales we‚Äôve told around a fire for millennia. We hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-056/">Read the issue now!</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[While we&#8217;re waiting here for autumn to arrive, there&#8217;s still a bit of time to&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we&#8217;re waiting here for autumn to arrive, there&#8217;s still a bit of time to settle into a comfortable chair in the sun for some reading. Might we suggest this latest fabulous issue of LSQ to keep you company?</p>
<p>Before you dig into the issue, however, we&#8217;d like to share and interview with the artist who created the beautiful, autumnal-tinted artwork that graces our cover.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><b><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium" src="https://harkale.art/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diva_fun_colours_internet.jpg" width="1800" height="1260" />Please tell us about the cover image, ‚ÄúWarm Embrace&#8221;. Is there a story behind this image? What was your thought process while creating this image?</b></span></p>
<p>‚ÄúWarm Embrace‚Äù is one of the few personal pieces I‚Äôve been able to work on in the past few years, in between client work. While creating art for other people, giving life to their ideas is great in its own way and often allows me to explore new ground, painting for myself means I get to put a lot of the things I love into an image. Warmth and love, big yummy abstract brushstrokes, a quiet scene, kindness, colours that aren‚Äôt what they seem (the green dress is actually a greyish orange, colours are fun!) and dramatic lighting,‚Ä¶ Like a warm cup of tea for the soul <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I needed that at the moment.</p>
<p>And the cool thing about art is that it resonates with other people even if they don‚Äôt see the same things in it, so I was actually brewing a big pot of tea for the entire village. For instance I pictured these two women as a couple, but other people told me they read them as a mother and daughter, making them think about the love they feel for their own mothers or daughters, and that‚Äôs very valid too.</p>
<p><b>Take us briefly through your artistic process. How do you create such captivating images?</b></p>
<p>Usually, my paintings are commissions, painted for books, games,‚Ä¶ that require a strict process where I explore different options in sketches, send a few of these sketches to the client, and after listening to their feedback refine one of these sketches into the painting itself. Most paintings on my website <a href="https://harkale.art/">harkale.art</a> fall into that category.<img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium" src="https://harkale.art/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/painting_internet.jpg" width="1412" height="2000" /></p>
<p>But when I create a painting entirely for myself the process is much looser, I start with a vague idea or a source of inspiration (which can be anything, from a specific colour palette, a feeling, a pretty tree I saw while hiking, a character I want to make fanart of,‚Ä¶) and then I go from there. I paint and move things around and erase details, it‚Äôs a messy process and certainly isn‚Äôt time-efficient, but it feels great!</p>
<p><b>When did you realize you wanted to focus on fantasy in your art? Did you start out as a fantasy artist, or have you noticed changes over time? Please tell us a bit about your art journey!</b></p>
<p>I began my art journey by enthusiastically redecorating my bedroom walls (and floor), like most toddlers do when you leave them unattended with a box of crayons for even a few minutes. My two main critics back then weren‚Äôt happy about it. Growing up, bandes dessin√©es (European comic books, in particular Yoko Tsuno and Thorgal, respectively drawn by the badass Roger Leloup and Grzegorz Rosi≈Ñski) were a huge source of inspiration for me. I was hoping to become a comic artist, but then life (and serious studies) got in the way.</p>
<p>It took me years to realise how much I loved painting, not just drawing. Playing with colours and lights and edges and my beloved brushstrokes. I was already a Very Respectable Adult when I rekindled my love for illustration, and since I‚Äôm such a big fantasy and sci-fi nerd my art naturally gravitated towards things that made me happy. And then people hired me to paint more fantasy art, which I‚Äôm never going to complain about.</p>
<p>My style evolved over time and it certainly will evolve further in the future, but I suspect I‚Äôll always like fantasy!</p>
<p><b>Do you have a personal favorite of the projects you‚Äôve worked on? Or one that was memorable due to its challenges? If so, can you tell us a bit about it?</b></p>
<p>Yes, ‚ÄúGrave to Cradle‚Äù. It was painted for a private client but I had a lot of freedom with that piece, and it ended up also being an homage to someone I was very close to, who passed away. The subject (skeleton contemplating flowers in their hand) isn‚Äôt that rare in fantasy art, but it‚Äôs the emotions I poured¬†<b style="color: #333333;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium" src="https://harkale.art/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton_internet.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" /></b><span style="color: #333333;">into this piece that makes it so special to me. To me, this piece is about loss and hope, planting the seeds for beautiful things to grow even after you‚Äôve died, no matter how far from perfection you think you are. And finding beauty outside even after the death of someone you were close to turned your world into a grey wasteland.</span></p>
<p>Of course other people see what resonates best with them in that painting, they‚Äôre welcome to. On a more light-hearted note, I‚Äôm proud of contrasting high-chroma blue with desaturated greens in the background, it‚Äôs so pretty!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-054/">Issue 054</a> is not your usual issue of LSQ. As our Creative Director Tara Lindsey so succinctly described it, this is beach reading for strange people. I hope that description intrigued you as much as it amused me, because that&#8217;s a perfect description as possible for this issue.</p>
<p>We are once again lucky enough to have a beautiful piece of art gracing the cover of the issue. This time it‚Äôs the work of <a href="https://indicreates.com/">Indicreates</a>, who shares a bit below about the piece on our cover as well as some insights into her process.</p>
<p><em><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-29320" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy-300x215.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy-1024x732.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy-768x549.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy-1536x1098.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-scales-and-wings-copy.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Please tell us about the cover image, ‚ÄúA Kind Face&#8221;. Is there a story behind this image? What was your thought process while creating this image?</em></p>
<p>I drew this illustration while going trough hard times, it was a symbol to myself to be kinder with myself. I printed it out so I‚Äôd remember it every time I look at it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve chosen green colors and flowers as both are calming to me.</p>
<p><em>Take us briefly through your artistic process. How do you create such captivating images?</em></p>
<p>I like to start with rough sketches, do research, listen to music that fits the art I‚Äôm going for and build my paintings from there.</p>
<p>At times I daydream and come up with ideas that way.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29321" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon-1024x471.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="336" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon-1024x471.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon-300x138.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon-768x353.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon-1536x706.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indi-creates-on-top-of-the-world-ptreon.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p><em>When did you realize you wanted to focus on fantasy in your art? Did you start out as a fantasy artist, or have you noticed changes over time? Please tell us a bit about your art journey!</em></p>
<p>I decided to focus on fantasy art in university, I realized I had most fun painting elves and fantasy worlds and that I have a deep love for worlds that feel different.</p>
<p>My love for fantasy started early, I already dreamed of other worlds as a kid and after many years of trying different things and building my skills I went back to my core in a way.</p>
<p>In my art I try to recreate the feeling of discovering new worlds.</p>
<p><em>Do you have a personal favorite of the projects you‚Äôve worked on? Or one that was memorable due to its challenges? If so, can you tell us a bit about it?</em></p>
<p>My personal art that is based on my childhood fantasies mean a lot to me, sadly I don‚Äôt have too much time for these pieces but I try my best to paint a bit from that world whenever I can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to get you up to speed on some behind the scenes work that has been going on here at LSQ HQ (i.e. my house). We&#8217;ve decided not to continue our contract with Submittable at this time. The cost for an operation our size is simply far too high and we would rather make use of our generous <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lunastation">Patreon</a> supporter&#8217;s funds elsewhere (more on that to come in future announcements).</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re no longer using Submittable, then how will authors submit their stories? Well, I&#8217;ve built a new submissions manager, customized for LSQ. <a href="https://submissions.lunastationpress.com/">You can find it here</a>. It works quite simply. Fill out the form, paste your story into the box, and hit the submit button, after reading our submission guidelines, of course.</p>
<p>Other than where you&#8217;re submitting your stories, there&#8217;s really no other changes to our process. Our deadlines remain the same, our editors will still read all your submissions, and we&#8217;ll continue to publish the wonderful women-identified writers that come through our door.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to use our contact form and I&#8217;ll get back to you ASAP.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support!</p>

<p><span style="color: #141414;"><b>Please tell us about the cover image, &#8220;The Prophet&#8221;. Is there a story behind this image? What was your thought process while creating this image?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">The character depicted in The Prophet is a generic depiction of a prophet level priestess from a story I am writing. In my story the Temple studies travel between planes. The spatial distortion emanating from her head and the coins she wears are unique to these priestesses. Coins have historically been used as both a symbol of travel and in some mythologies as payment to cross certain mythological rivers etc. Since the Temple‚Äôs main theme is ‚Äútravel‚Äù, the priestesses use coins as symbols of status rather than bartering. In short, the priestesses run a temple where certain gifted beings can travel between planes. The adornment of these coins represent levels of superiority/status. A lower level initiate would have only a few coins worn in their hair or as earrings. Prophets are recognized as high-mid level in the Temple‚Äôs system. Can you imagine how many coins the leaders have? It‚Äôs an ostentatious, ridiculous amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59c05896cd39c3d49bffe7a4/1672692308110-D9GMBSI1H33BJ19N3S3H/image-asset.png" alt="The Prophet artwork by Olivia Hintz" width="1930" height="2474" />Most, if not all, of my work, derives from storytelling. When I visualize an illustration as part of a larger story, I can better decide what attributes, items, etc., the character should have and the emotional reaction I want to evoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">I am also a sucker for world-building. While I love painting faces most, some of my favorite illustrations are of plants, stone and other natural elements that bring a world to life. With The Prophet, I decided her surroundings should depict one of the planes I have built in my (hopefully) one-day-fully-realized graphic novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;"><b>Take us briefly through your artistic process. How do you create such captivating images?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">I am still learning what I enjoy and what works for me. With The Prophet, I didn&#8217;t start with a sketch as I most definitely should have. Instead, I gathered some inspirational images and went straight to painting. Luckily, the structure did not change much. Sometimes this process works and sometimes the painting ends up in the &#8220;Hazard: Work In Progress&#8221; folder for eternity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">The one thing I always do is gather references. It was such a taboo in art school. I&#8217;m glad artists are starting to push the notion that it&#8217;s necessary and welcomed. Using references is smart and efficient‚Äîno one should feel guilty looking up a 13th-century arbalest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;"><b>When did you realize you wanted to focus on fantasy in your art? Did you start out as a fantasy artist, or have you noticed changes over time? Please tell us a bit about your art journey!</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">I have always been a fantasy nerd. Lord of the Rings, Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">Growing up, I never thought of fantasy art as a career. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to attend art school and supportive parents, who had no idea what an art career entails besides hustling paintings and eating from cans. They were great, though, and I&#8217;m super appreciative of my folks. I know a lot of artist friends whose parents refuse to support their creative path, so I count myself extremely lucky.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">My main goal was to be a graphic novelist, taking inspiration from the Japanese comic market and Rumiko Takahashi&#8217;s works like Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha. Though, going to a school for fine art was probably not the best choice for a comic artist. I spent a few years after art school working various jobs to support myself, barely touching art again until I found Critical Role, a Dungeons and Dragons twitch stream. It was a gateway into the fantasy community, inspiring fan art and forcing me to learn digital painting. After investing in Smarterartschool and Swatches digital art courses, I‚Äôm at the point of freshly breaking into the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;"><b>Do you have a personal favorite of the projects you&#8217;ve worked on? Or one that was memorable due to its challenges? If so, can you tell us a bit about it?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">Every piece in my portfolio had its ups and downs. I don&#8217;t have a favorite, but several pieces changed how I draw and think about art.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">The first piece is called An Earthly Encounter: Harrowing Sentinel. It was a challenge issued by MTG artist Clint Cearley on his YouTube channel &#8220;Swatches.&#8221; Getting feedback from a professional at the time was incredible. My artwork jumped from a wavering understanding of digital painting to another level. I&#8217;ll forever be appreciative of the help I got from him.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium" style="color: #141414;" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59c05896cd39c3d49bffe7a4/1639357725476-45T6N12X2TQAJHTKYJQK/20210115_093231.jpg" alt="An Earthly Encounter artwork by Olivia Hintz" width="2500" height="1837" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">The piece Lava River, with guidance from Donato Giancola, furthered my art into a deeper understanding of composition and reference gathering. I started taking more time to develop how a piece works and what I want it to look like when finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #141414;">The last piece I feel similarly about is a current work. Unfortunately, I cannot show it. But it will be out in a few months! It&#8217;s a multi-figure piece with horses and a castle depicting King Arthur and his knights on the way out of Camelot. It&#8217;s the most challenging illustration I&#8217;ve worked on yet. Greg Manchess and Scott Fischer gave me some invaluable advice with this piece, and I&#8217;m very excited to share it in the Arthurian Zine it&#8217;s a part of!</span></p>
