					<description><![CDATA[And so we&#8217;ve reached our final Issue 049 author interview. We hope you&#8217;ve had as&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And so we&#8217;ve reached our final <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interview. We hope you&#8217;ve had as much fun getting to know our authors as we did! Sarah Dropek is here with us today to wrap things up with a discussion of her story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/swallow-it-down/">Swallow It Down</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Whoa! This story was a huge surprise to me, in the best and creepiest kind of way! I did NOT see that ending coming. When you started writing this story, was that the end you had already envisioned, or did you have to start more slowly and let it come to you as you went?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sarah: I’m so glad you liked it! Endings and titles are the trickiest of things for me. I’m still doing a lot of learning about writing and about my own process with each story I begin, so I don’t have a one-size-fits-all method to any of my ideas. I’ve started stories with the end in mind (though it often changes as I go) and I’ve discovery written my way to endings that were mysteries to me until something clicked, and it came together.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-27678 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-GHGweXclrXs-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />This story began with a desire to write a relationship between two family members where, by the end, neither person could be considered “the good guy.” From there, the characters took shape in my mind quite quickly. Since Catherine’s big driver was to get as much distance from her mother as possible, I knew I needed to find a way to push them as close together as I could. So I cajoled my plot to necessitate they live in the same house. Once I had Catherine brushing her mother’s hair, I knew I wanted to linger on that moment of care for someone she disliked so much. And then hair sparked the next evolution of the story.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the house I grew up in, there was a snag of hair in the corner of the attic door on the ceiling right outside my bedroom door. I never succeeded in convincing myself it belonged to anyone in my family and since then, hair has always unnerved me a little. The way it feels to see a stranger’s strands of hair somewhere you don’t expect, how it always seems to make frightening pictures on the shower wall, or how it tickles until you have to check if a bug is on your neck. That attic did a number on me. Once I knew I wanted to use hair somehow to push Catherine even closer to her mother, the ending felt like it fell into place with its own agenda.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>LSQ: The dynamic between Catherine and her mother feels age-old, and part of what made me so surprised was the lack of surprise at how Catherine was feeling as the story went on. Even her acts of consumption were both a shock and not. The biggest clues seem to come from Brianna, but I only realized that in hindsight. The tension is just delicious—a bite-sized thriller. What sort of journey are you trying to take a reader on as they go through &#8220;Swallow It Down&#8221;?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sarah: Being in a family can be amazing. It can also feel impossible sometimes. I’m always curious how we push and pull at each other in this group of people we didn’t ever ask to live with.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With Catherine and her mother, I wanted to explore the idea that maybe there is a distance in familial relationships between who we are, who another person is, and what we wish they might be, that will always mean we misunderstand each other, make missteps, or put someone in a box they don’t want to be in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I think that at some point, every kid has felt that their parent doesn’t ‘get’ them or wishes they were different. I wanted Catherine to embody that visceral frustration against her disappointed and sniping mother. I wanted a reader to rally behind Catherine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But I wanted to show that her mother suffers the same misunderstandings from her daughter, too. When Meggie takes over Catherine’s body and steals her life with a vivaciousness Catherine didn’t have, the question is which woman was right, which was wrong. But my hope is that the answer is neither. My hope is for the real answer to be that these are two people, giving up after struggling to coexist when they were too different to ever succeed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t sound like a very hopeful outlook, but I think there is also freedom in letting go of trying so hard for a closeness that isn’t possible. And it’s probably a reach, but maybe through reading Meggie and Catherine’s story, we can do better than them simply by beginning from a place of tenderness towards that difficulty of understanding and being understood in any relationship.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: The hint of the supernatural is intriguing here. I both want and don’t want to see what happens next—does Meggie lose her job because she doesn’t know how to code, does Brianna ever wonder to herself “What on earth was that?” Did you rely on any particular inspiration when it came to deciding how the swap came about? Is this something you enjoy reading as well as writing?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sarah: I love a good story where no one wins and that was decidedly my plan for this one! The future for Meggie is pretty bleak in my mind. Maybe she gets a few good days in, but her own hubris in thinking she could live her daughter’s life better than she had catches up with her and things fall apart pretty quickly. Job loss for sure, I imagine Brianna would get pretty suspicious at “Catherine’s” change in demeanor and report it somehow. No one really comes out unscathed, and there’s quite a lot of regret to share among the three women.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think I’m alone in gravitating towards writing and reading things that really twist the knife in deeper. In a world where good and bad things happen in a way that can feel both inevitable <em>and</em> completely random, I like to read fiction that mirrors that. It’s a salve, I think, to my brain that’s always trying to make sense of things, when there is often no sense to be had.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I do love reading a happy ending every once in a while, but too many of them in a row can make reality hard to stomach. So, there’s something strangely soothing about a dark and brutal story that can hold my fear and also help me better notice the glimmers of light in the world</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Only two Issue 049 author interviews left! Be sure to savor them! Today&#8217;s treat is&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only two <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interviews left! Be sure to savor them! Today&#8217;s treat is Rebecca Harrison&#8217;s answers to our questions about her story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/the-paper-child/">The Paper Child</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: This is so beautiful and desperate and sad. Your descriptions are absolutely sublime. What was your inspiration for &#8220;The Paper Child&#8221;? When you sat down to write this, what was the first scene that sprang into your mind?</strong></em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27676 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/laura-kapfer-hmCMUZKLxa4-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />Rebecca: Thank you heaps for your kind words. I made up the story yonks ago but didn&#8217;t get round to write it until recently because I&#8217;m 80% sloth. (The remaining 20% is crisps, or chips, as you call them.)  I can&#8217;t really remember my inspiration for the story itself, but the first scene that sprang to mind when I started writing it was def the end. Possibly because what could be worse than someone burning your library. <img decoding="async" class="an1" src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f609/32.png" alt="?" data-emoji="?" aria-label="?" /> I&#8217;m a book obsessive and forever being told that I have too many books, but that&#8217;s simply not true when you think about how many books there actually are in the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I had to look up a fair number of these words, and yet not knowing them in the moment didn’t take me out of the story—it seemed like I could feel the goselet rain, despite not knowing what exactly what “goselet” meant. Were they all familiar to you when you began writing, or did you come up with the feeling you wanted for a particular sentence and then look to find a word that fit it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Rebecca: I only knew a few of them! I kept getting stuck when I was writing the first line because I didn&#8217;t like using the word &#8216;baby&#8217;, and then I realized I could opt for &#8216;bairn&#8217; which means child, really, but it gave me the excuse to shove in lots of delicious Scottish words. I did try to use them so that they wouldn&#8217;t need too much looking up. But I had loads of fun learning them. The only stumbling block came when the online Scottish dictionary told me there was no word for &#8216;sunny&#8217;. Bahahaha. Which basically means Scotland is the perfect country. I&#8217;m a gloom aficionado.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: The ending is just—oh my. Usually I ask authors if they see a way to continue their story, but this one seems rather final for these particular characters. Would you revisit this world in another work, though?</strong></em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27675 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-768x960.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/koshu-kunii-lUuxo1OWtoA-unsplash-scaled.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>Rebecca: I don&#8217;t think I could go back to these characters because they&#8217;re pretty much done. But I did love writing a gothic, and have just finished a gothic novella which was <em>Jane Eyre</em> meets <em>The Wicker Man</em>. It didn&#8217;t have any yummy Scottish words but my MC was a composer who used musical terms to describe stuff and they&#8217;re almost as good. I set it in the 1780s at The White Horse which is the ancient figure carved into a hill in the British countryside. It was one of my favorite places as a child.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearing other writers&#8217; inspirations is so interesting. We&#8217;re lucky our authors are kind enough to share theirs with us! Today&#8217;s sharing is caring moment is sponsored by K. Hartless and her <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/eclectibles/">Eclectibles</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: This story is absolutely lovely, and seems rather prescient as well. It made me wonder whether I have any appropriate books on my shelves for futuristic ailments like the ones you describe. What was your story inspired by?</strong></em></p>
<p>K.: As a teacher, I see the glaze of screens all too frequently in my student&#8217;s eyes: both young students and adult students. A huge part of the battle to awaken their imaginations is getting them to grasp a physical book. As a traveler, one of the first places I seek out in a new city is a <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-27593 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jaredd-craig-HH4WBGNyltc-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />bookstore, or even better, a used bookstore. It is one of these bookstores in Munich, <i>The Munich Readery</i>, that I took a seminar in 2019 for female writers about overcoming your inner critique. The bookshop owner walked me through the blockages I had long harbored about embracing my poetry, my stories, and ultimately my voice. It is from this seminar that the character of the cleric was born. I thought of all the miracles on the shelves of a used bookstore, and how the stories in these books can be medicine, bandages, cures even.  Each is an experience waiting to change a reader&#8217;s life. Surrounded by the stacks of books, I remember thinking: what will become of this place in the future? “Electibles<i>”</i> is my bravest hope that printed books will forever be a part of the human experience. I like to keep my shelves well-stocked so that I have that perfect book for a student in need of something that will change them and help them to live a better life.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I love how much worldbuilding you put into so few words. Simple sentences describing the family nest and the digital work they do give a lot of insight into this setting. Overall, your story is fairly short but still so rich. Did you write longer to begin with, or was it always so concise?</strong></em></p>
<p>K.: Thank you for this compliment. I think it&#8217;s my poetic background, but I tend to be a more skeletal writer. I love the challenge of creating amazing narratives with sparse word counts. Also, on my journey as a writer, I started with creating micro fiction, flash fiction, and then short stories. The word counts were like railings helping me to build more and more complex stories. Now that I&#8217;ve completed a draft of a full-length novel, I still return to shorter fictional forms, a nice relaxing shallow pool after treading in the deep end.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: It feels like the owner of Eclectibles would make a wonderful centerpiece for a collection of short stories. Have you considered writing more in this world? If you did, what or who do you think you would focus on?</strong></em></p>
<p>K.: Yes, I do foresee more stories set in my strip mall of the future. Perhaps more stories about <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-27594 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-blowup-eOwKJhd6k8-unsplash-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />the cleric, but also some other shops. Right now, I&#8217;m drafting a short story titled &#8220;Aromas&#8221; about a perfume shop in the future that buys and sells dreams. I like the idea of the familiar setting of a strip mall, but reconceiving what the future holds for these storefronts. I am hoping to create a story about a future grocery store, a future bike shop, and perhaps a future coffee shop, as well. It&#8217;s endless fun reimagining these shopping experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fear not, dear readers, we still have a few <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interviews on hand! Today we&#8217;re talking with Rine Karr about her sci-fi story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/rhyme-and-reason/">Rhyme and Reason</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ:  I love a good rescue story. The interplay between Raison and Rhyme is exciting, especially as we see them fighting to keep their ship together. What part of this story came to you first—the relationship between Raison and Rhyme, or the scenario of a crash-landing?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27587 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-768x768.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nasa-cIX5TlQ_FgM-unsplash-550x550.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Rine: I want to say that both parts of the story came to me simultaneously—both the relationship between Rhyme and the Raison and the crash-landing scenario. I&#8217;ve been working on a sci-fi novel for a while now, and for whatever reason, a crash-landing scenario depicting a relationship between a human and an artificial—an artificial intelligence—kept coming to mind, but it had no place in my novel. So I began exploring this scene on the side as a potential short story, which I began drafting shortly after the start of the pandemic. I had this need, for some reason, to write this story down; it just kept haunting me! The relationship between Rhyme and the Raison, in particular, was something I felt I needed to explore. I think I was channeling some of my feelings at the time regarding loneliness, fear, and this new world we were all facing, specifically how interacting with other people solely through technology and screens had become our reality. I imagined that these sort of disembodied interactions I was having might be what it would feel like to interact with a sentient artificial intelligence, so I decided to play with that idea in a short story.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Stories like this always make me curious about the future of humanity’s interconnectedness with technology. Do you see connections like the one Rhyme and Raison share as possible someday?</strong></em></p>
<p>Rine: I am no expert when it comes to artificial intelligence or biotechnology or what is even possible science-wise regarding technology and the human body, although I do try to learn about these things, but I too have always been fascinated by our ever-changing relationship with technology, and I would like to hope that a positive connection like the one between Rhyme and the Raison would be possible someday. This hope is definitely inspired by some of the sci-fi stories I&#8217;ve consumed over the years—<i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, <i>Mass Effect, Star Trek,</i> and the Imperial Radch trilogy come to mind. Even as our society struggles with inequitable algorithms, surveillance capitalism, the spread of misleading information, and other problems that human-made technology has produced, technology does result in positive outcomes too, and I think I wanted to show that in this story by exploring the possibility that we might become friends with our computers someday.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: You share some wonderful bits of worldbuilding in this story—one of my faves is “biomother”—that makes me think there’s a lot more to this world than meets the eye. Would you revisit these two, in their new incarnation, in another story?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27586 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bohdan-d-sfXvVVLhcE0-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Rine: I&#8217;m so glad you noticed and liked my little nods to other aspects of this world I&#8217;ve created—am still creating. Like I said, I&#8217;ve been working on a sci-fi novel for a while now, and this short story sort of stems from that worldbuilding. I&#8217;m still working things out all the time and my ideas are bound to change, but &#8220;biomother&#8221; is also one of my favorites. It hints at the kind of society Rhyme comes from—a society that has expanded its definition of family. A society in which children may or may not have a &#8220;biomother.&#8221; A society in which children may have multiple mothers or fathers or guardians. A society that raises its children more collectively. A society that is so technologically advanced that reproduction is no longer solely biologically-based. But I digress and to answer your question: no, I haven&#8217;t thought too deeply yet about writing these two characters into another story, although I have played with the idea of having them show up, possibly in their new incarnation, in my novel. At the moment, I feel like the Raison is more likely to show up on its own than with Rhyme, but we&#8217;ll have to see how it goes!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Still hungering for more Issue 049 author interviews? Today Katherine Shats offers a different kind&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still hungering for more <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interviews? Today Katherine Shats offers a different kind of cuisine with &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/the-butterfly-eater/">The Butterfly Eater</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I just loved this story. It was moving and crass, hopeful and despicable, endearing and cynical all at once. I’d love to know where the idea for this story came from.</strong></em></p>
<p>Katherine: Thank you! I love that description of the story. My partner and I were sorting through old papers and memories and decided that instead of keeping them locked away in a box, we would cut them out into butterfly shapes and suspend them on string on a large canvas. As I sat there for hours cutting up childhood diaries, photos, paintings, wedding invitations, my cat&#8217;s adoption papers and letters from my past, the idea of taking something from your inner world and putting it out into the universe started forming in my mind. Then I had fun taking it to a darker place, and playing with taste as a way to perceive (and enjoy) others&#8217; pain, hope and desire.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Were you set on butterflies as the medium of “spiritual access,” so to speak, from the start?</strong></em></p>
<p>Katherine: I was quite set on butterflies, as they already represent hope, change and spiritual rebirth. But what I loved most was how fragile they are and the vulnerability and courage it would take to place your deepest hopes, dreams, pain and suffering into such a fragile creature and watch it fly away.  That, and while cutting out the physical butterflies, I&#8217;d get distracted and lose a whole wing or cut a butterfly in half, losing that piece of paper and the memory it represented forever. Much like in the story, once a butterfly carrying your hope flies away, you have no control over where it would end up &#8211; like with our butterfly eater.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: How did you decide how much information to give readers about Ted and the butterfly eater? I find myself wondering what’s happened to him since that first childhood wish and the present day, where he’s confronting the butterfly eater and yet…not quite confronting her.</strong></em></p>
<p>Katherine: I ended up stripping these characters down to what was most important for the essence of the story in that one interaction. They both represent different sides of hope, cynicism and vulnerability. Ted is a believer, though perhaps a little naive, and has complete faith in the spiritual traditions of the festival, seeking to protect them at any cost. In his worldview, the only purpose and value lies in the butterflies reaching their destination, whether that be the Goddess or something else. Meanwhile, the Butterfly Eater completely dismisses their traditions, and crunches down on these already fragile butterflies like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. It&#8217;s such a contrast to everything Ted has ever known that mostly, he&#8217;s just shocked. I wonder, and perhaps some readers will as well, if she really is the cynical one after all, since she&#8217;s the only one that sees how the very act of coming to the festival and participating in the ritual is itself a precious expression of hope, regardless of where they end up. She also happens to find them particularly tasty.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I really like the idea of releasing a little bit of the hope and fear and stress of life this way. If you could have one small magic like this be part of your life, what would it be?</strong></em></p>
<p>Katherine: I do like the idea of having one small magic like this! Perhaps I would close my eyes and blow my hopes and fears and stress into a small cloud or bubble (cloud in a bubble?), and show it to those closest to me. They might see some hope and beauty that I couldn&#8217;t, and I would like to do the same for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grab a snack, dear readers, because today’s <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interview is going to make you hungry! We’re talking with Agnieszka Hałas about her story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/the-best-pierogi-in-kocierba/">The Best Pierogi in Kocierba</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: There are so many layers to this story, it’s hard to know where to start. I suppose I should first confess that I looked up glass mountains as soon as I finished this story, just in case I was missing something so geologically exquisite. How did you get the idea for this story?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27551 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/karolina-kolodziejczak-aRohedHupgc-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />Agnieszka: The original story about the Glass Mountain (the one told by Mira, where the hero is a ragged but resourceful student who uses lynx claws to climb) is an old Polish fairy tale. I&#8217;ve known it since childhood, and it&#8217;s the kind of story that just asks to be rewoven into something<br />
new. Paweł&#8217;s story crystallized in my mind after some beautiful summer hikes in the Low Beskids in southeastern Poland, where pierogi stuffed with mashed potatoes and quark cheese are a very popular (and tasty) dish.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Paweł makes a number of deprecating comments about fairy tales <span class="im">early in the story, but by the end he has a, at least metaphorical, </span>change of heart. How did you decide what Paweł should take seriously, <span class="im">and when? Did his arc evolve as you wrote the story, or did you begin it knowing exactly where you wanted it to end?</span></strong></em></p>
<p>Agnieszka: I wrote the Polish version of the story back in 2017, so I don&#8217;t remember precisely how the pieces came together in my mind, but I&#8217;m 99% sure that I knew from the outset how it would end. The idea is that Paweł was raised to think that life won&#8217;t ever let you follow<br />
your dreams, and this has been a self-fulfilling prophecy. Now he&#8217;s stuck in a rut, so to speak, without much hope. But deep down inside he&#8217;s a dreamer, and it only takes one conversation, one push to give him confidence, because he has always wanted to climb a &#8216;real&#8217; glass mountain, i.e. build a happy life for himself, not just an existence.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I would love for Mira to actually be the magical being that Paweł <span class="im">suspects she might be by the end. If she were part of the fairy tale of the princess and the glass mountain, who would she be?</span></strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27552 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-214x300.jpg 214w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-1463x2048.jpg 1463w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/richard-sagredo-oT5F4u7A9cw-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1829w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>Agnieszka: I intentionally left Mira&#8217;s identity unsaid. She isn&#8217;t any specific being from the broad Slavic repertoire of magical creatures. My suggestion is that long ago, Mira might actually have been the princess from the Glass Mountain tale. In that tale, she&#8217;s a symbol/archetype: she embodies a dream, a prize to be won, and motivates heroes to act. Thousands of years later she&#8217;d absolutely know the value and price of following one&#8217;s heart. Alternatively, if you prefer, Mira might be one of those wise fairies that give advice to the lost, show up at christenings to offer gifts, and so on.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to another Issue 049 author interview. We had a blast talking with Paulene Turner&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interview. We had a blast talking with Paulene Turner about the inspiration behind her story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/soul-mate/">Soul Mate</a>&#8220;!</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: This was such a fun story! I feel like it’s the sort of thing that could be expanded into an entire UF novel, but it works so well as a short too. What was your inspiration for &#8220;Soul Mate&#8221;?</strong></em></p>
<p>Paulene: The inspiration for &#8220;Soul Mate was&#8221; a house a couple of streets away from me in Greenwich, Sydney. It’s a beautiful house, quite traditional. On one of my many walks around the suburb during the long Sydney lockdowns, I noticed the grass had grown long, and cobwebs slung across the driveway were undisturbed. And the curtains never moved. Or did they? Clearly, the owners were spending COVID elsewhere. The house lay empty, awaiting their return. Somehow it had an other-worldly quality.  And I wondered, what if it wasn’t really empty?</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: I love the celebrities you picked to be part of the almost never-ending afterlife. Poor Shakespeare, he’ll be there forever. How did you decide on who to include, and what role to give them?</strong></em></p>
<p>Paulene: I thought about who might be there for a while, in this situation &#8211; the much beloved celebs. Shakespeare, obviously! And Elvis! David Bowie. Marilyn! And I researched what some of the people actually ate for breakfast. It wasn’t hard to imagine what sort of chaos might ensue with them all in the one place together.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Would you consider writing more in this setting? I’m serious when I say that I think this sort of afterlife would make a really fun novel!</strong></em></p>
<p>Paulene: This might sound strange, but ghost stories scare the life out of me. I don’t think I  could linger too long with the idea of spirits before I’d freak myself out. So, no. Despite that, some of the ghost stories I’ve been forced to write for a competition have turned out to be the most satisfying of any stories I’ve written. I think it’s because I naturally turn towards the comic but when it comes to ghosts, and issues of life and death, there’s always something serious buried there about love and loss and saying goodbye.  So I’m forced to be serious for a moment. And that combo of humor and tenderness is a potent one. But spooky ghost stories! If I tried to write one, I’d probably end up under my desk, scaring myself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspiration and writing techniques abound in our <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interviews! Today Ivy Grimes, author of &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/the-goddess-of-fear/">The Goddess of Fear</a>,&#8221; shares some of her writing process with us.</p>
<p><span class="im"><em><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27469 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/victoriano-izquierdo-HoevDVvxInw-unsplash-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />LSQ: You wrote one of the best first lines I’ve ever read for this story. It gripped me immediately, the seeming dichotomy of safety and fear. Was this one of the first lines that came to you, or did you rework it over and over until you found the perfect balance?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Ivy: Thank you! I actually think I started with &#8220;The beast cannot enter. The Goddess of Fear is stronger.&#8221; In revision, I circled back and set up my main character and setting (not something I always do in the first line), and I came upon the idea that she was safe in the Temple of the Goddess of Fear. And it seemed true, so I kept it.</p>
<p><span class="im"><em><strong>LSQ: Fear as constructive isn’t an angle that seems to get looked at very often, in real life or in fiction. By the end of this story, though, I was completely invested in the Goddess of Fear and her priestesses. How did your personal beliefs about fear help or hinder you in figuring this story out?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Ivy: I struggle with anxiety, but I also have positive feelings towards anxiety. Sometimes it sends false alarms, and sometimes it alerts me to real danger. And while I can take steps to mitigate my anxiety, I can&#8217;t eliminate it entirely&#8230;so I might as well embrace its reality. In some ways, Thora has been ignoring her fear. Thora&#8217;s feelings of love and responsibility lead her until the priestesses take her in and show her the potential power and wisdom in fear.</p>
<p>I also love mystics who enter trance states and bring wisdom to others. I think storytelling involves a similar process. I thought it was sort of funny but also meaningful that the priestesses of fear must have terrors every day for the sake of the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: </strong></em><span class="im"><em><strong>I love the star-crossed lovers angle, but I also love the idea that, in fact, love for another doesn’t have to be everything. Just as Jon made choices that led to his situation out of a desire to elevate himself, so Thora made the choice to love her own life more than an uncertain future with Jon. What do you hope readers take away as the central message of “The Goddess of Fear,” and would you ever write the stories of other gods and goddesses and their temples?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Ivy: When relationships (whether romantic or otherwise) end, we can feel uprooted. It can seem like we don&#8217;t belong anywhere. This story would probably resonate most with someone who has actually been afraid of a partner, but I feel like it&#8217;s relevant to anyone who has experienced the death of any kind of relationship (friendship, family, etc.). I would hope this story could serve as a reminder that new relationships will come, and there are safe places. I hope Jon finds a safe place, too, where he can heal.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to explore the other deities (and other mental states and emotions)! It would also be interesting to explore deities whose gender is fluid. In this story, I felt like I needed a Goddess of Fear because Thora ultimately needed to confront an avatar of herself so she could learn how strong she was.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author interview, Erin MacNair talks about her story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/thin-crust/">Thin Crust</a>&#8221; and the importance of having fun while writing.</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: </strong></em><em><strong>Reading this was a rollercoaster of “what if” scenarios racing through my mind, and by the end of it I kind of wanted to laugh along with the scientists, just to dispel some of the tension! You do a brilliant job of keeping the reader guessing. What inspired this story?</strong></em></p>

I think we all worry to some degree about the world ending, an existential gear that’s grinding in the background of our thoughts. I know I do. So the craziness of the idea that we might just be eaten for a snack helps me in some way, helps me realize worrying about something I can’t do much about isn’t healthy for me. Many people have religion to help them sort out their fears, I applaud it; I use short stories. Whatever works! Whether or not this will actually help anyone else let go of things they cannot control is a mystery, but at the very least I hope to bring a laugh or two.</p>
<div>I’d also been reading about people who believe in a flat earth, marveling at how one comes to dispel the science proving otherwise. As I was thinking about this, I took a bite of cracker, and thought, yeah, so the earth is like this, and I’m just having a bite. And the idea came into my head, and I began making some notes, all starting with “what if”. Often my ideas start with a question, and seeing what the answer is often not what I expect! I don’t usually come to ideas while snacking, though. Usually it’s right before I’m trying to fall asleep!</div>
<div></div>
<div><em><strong>LSQ: How did you decide on the structure of &#8220;Thin Crust,&#8221; which perspectives to take on the calamity at hand?</strong></em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Erin: I love weaving a braided narrative, a back and forth that leaves a reader guessing. It’s my favorite way to tell a story: I just have to keep the reader wanting to stay on the ride. I had a few random ideas for who might “witness” the event, and just went from there. I’m not even sure how I came to decide the locations, because I’ve never been to any of the places mentioned. I just knew I wanted the locations to be beautiful, places I’d want to see one day. I wrote down the ideas, and did the research afterward to make sure they were sound and rooted in reality, places one could actually get to. I did have a vision of the people in the boat yelling “agghhhh” which made me laugh out loud. I knew that scene had to be in there. I’m a big fan of irony and dark humor, as you can tell.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wanted to start with a fisherman, staring out to sea, because the ocean is this giant powerful force that sustains so much life. I wanted to start with its contemplation, and a person who’d devoted his life to it, let him be the first to see our end. There is something about the noble call of the lone fisherman that appeals to me as well, as one who feeds others.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The scientist was there in my thoughts as someone who might try and save us-but in the end he just accepts something science could never explain. The couple came to mind as two people yearning for meaning in their lives, trying to find their way but going in opposite directions. I just ran with a few ideas and filled in the rest as they came, really.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em><strong>LSQ: One of the things about your story that I really appreciate is how you managed to get me invested in every person you spoke through and about, even if it was just with a few lines of text. Was this a story that flowed easily for you, or did you pore over every sentence making sure it had the meaning you were going for?</strong></em></div>

<div>Erin: That’s great, thank you. Knowing your characters land well with readers is always something a writer wants to hear! And this story came out in a flood, almost of its own volition. I’d like to think it’s what happens when the muse is with you.</div>

<div class="nH g">I wrote the whole piece in one session, something I almost never do. Then I fleshed out the characters, checked the science was correct, the locations, and then went in to edit. Subtraction is a powerful tool, to say more with less. But oddly, there wasn’t a ton to do this time. I’ve spent years re-working pieces that still aren’t right. Lucky for me, this wasn’t one of them. I think because I just let go of knowing what was going to happen and let myself have fun, it clicked. I’m trying to do that more in my work, give myself permission to be as strange as I want and see what comes out. The meaning seems to come though if I let go, trusting myself to get there.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talking fish and wishes gone bad: just another Tuesday on the LSQ blog! Join us as we chat with <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/issue/issue-049/">Issue 049</a> author Cindy Phan about her fairytale-inspired story &#8220;<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/story/alistair-catfish/">Alistair Catfish</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Okay, I have to say first that I’m so impressed with just how funny you managed to make this story. It was also sad, and a little terrifying in that ONE SPOT, oh my gosh, but the funny is the part that stuck with me. Is that something you worked at, or does it just come naturally into your writing?</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27382 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milos-prelevic-uWLvruHp8kY-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Cindy: Thank you for saying such nice things about my story! And funny you should mention the funny in &#8220;Alistair Catfish&#8221;: lately my stories have taken quite a dark and serious turn, and I love it, but it is new and strange and is taking some getting used to.</p>
<p>Because generally, yes, my writing tends to veer into the more comical side things. It’s not something I actively work at; it just kind of happens that way and I just go with it.</p>
<p>Actually, humour and heartbreak, I think, are connected, often in some rather unexpected ways. Which is maybe why &#8220;Alistair Catfish&#8221; is, as you said, also sad and, yes, there’s that bit of terror in it!</p>
<p><em><strong>LSQ: Wish-granting animals, including fish, pop up in a number of fairytales. Did you take inspiration from any one in particular?</strong></em></p>
<p>Cindy: &#8220;The Fisherman and His Wife&#8221; has stuck with me since I first heard it as a kid. I think I was five? Maybe six. The covetous wife pushes the kind-hearted fisherman to make more and more outlandish wishes of the poor fish (a nice house, better clothes, more money, etc.) until the world is nearly brought to ruin.</p>
<div>
<p>And the Fisherman does it because, supposedly, of his kind heart, even though he <i>knows</i> that it’s causing the sea to churn and boil away. He’s not accountable for anything, we must sympathize with him because it’s the wife’s fault, and all that’s, well, fishy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So in &#8220;Alistair Catfish&#8221; I explored how you can convince yourself of hoarding the things you believe you deserve and, of course, the things you convince yourself to do (i.e. that you &#8220;have&#8221; to do) in order to get them…things that, by the way, seem <i>very conveniently</i> to absolve you of the consequences in attaining them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Oh! But my biggest take away as a kid and especially as I got older was very much, “OMG. You <i>met</i> a <i>talking fish</i>?!” A talking fish <i>for real </i>and look what you did.</p>
</div>
<div>Fool.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em><strong>LSQ: There’s a delicious parity to the ending of this story that I love. Did you start writing this knowing the ending you were working toward, or did it all fall into place over the course of writing it?</strong></em></div>
<div></div>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-27383 alignright" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/javier-molina-P92eXLRNFH8-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<div>
<p>Cindy: I had an idea of where the story was going as I was writing it, and it was a lot of fun setting up the exact parameters for the wish making that Colin, covetous himself, was more than willing to navigate in order to procure wishes from Alistair Catfish.</p>
<p>But the rest of it was mostly vibes that fell into place as I went on to the ending. Colin getting what he threatened to give (as in mete out) to Alistair Catfish was a surprise, but seemed, if not entirely right, then at least fair enough for the time being.</p>
<p>Same as in life, fiction can be funny that way.</p>
