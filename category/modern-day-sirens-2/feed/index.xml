										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-28385 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-4-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-4-300x300.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-4-150x150.png 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-4.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This month’s modern-day siren admits to hearing voices, sometimes in the form of a chant and other times in a skat-style melody without any words, and while singer-songwriter Valerie June knows her creative process is “kinda weird,” she maintains that in order to write new music, the main thing she has to do is listen to the universe.</p>
<p>Growing up in Jackson, Tennessee, the daughter of a music promoter, Valerie was exposed to a variety of music genres at a young age. When asked about how she would categorize her music she told NPR,<strong> “I don’t feel like I should have to have rules.”</strong> Valerie’s fluid voice has been described as “an ocean wave that carries the listener along with it.” The rippling sounds in her songs blend gospel, country, and folk with touches of Appalachian bluegrass.</p>
<p>Valerie didn’t start playing guitar until her early twenties, then picked up the banjo and finally the ukulele which she lovingly calls ‘the baby’. With folk musical idols like Skip James, Elizabeth Cotton, and Etta Baker, Valerie strives to create music that is fresh but pays the utmost respect to the musicians that came before.</p>
<p>She calls her first album,<strong><em> “Pushin’ Against A Stone,</em>”</strong> a “bootlegger bedroom recording,” meaning whatever money could be put aside from working went straight into studio time to record her latest songs, from bedroom to album.</p>
<p>For two years, Valerie transited between New York and Memphis, playing music, and selling albums out of her car. “Hustling,” she called it, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/?country=US">Kickstarter</a> enabled her to complete her first full album in 2013, with a tribute to women everywhere titled, “Workin’ Woman Blues.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Valerie June - &quot;Workin&#039; Woman Blues&quot; (Pushin&#039; Against A Stone)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5_g5_q20I8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Not only does this siren have a unique musical style, but she also has eclectic creative tastes. Valerie enjoys collecting vintage clothing and creating her own styles, but admits, “It’s hard to bring a sewing machine on the road.” Whenever she arrives in a new town, she takes a daily stroll and searches for clothes in local shops. <strong>“So, when you’re thinking, what’s Valerie June doing this weekend? She’s probably at home having a fashion show.” </strong></p>
<p>In addition to sewing, Valerie also enjoys painting. “I paint large,” she shares in an interview at Middletree Studio. “Whenever I feel like it, I go paint,” and she points out a wall-size canvas of a work that took her several years to complete.</p>
<p>Valerie’s 2021 album <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Stars-Prescriptions-Dreamers/dp/B08STTNTW7">“The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers”</a> includes a song feature from her musical “fairy godmother” Carla Thomas. To Valerie this is perfectly natural, <strong>“Every dreamer’s journey has to have a fairy godmother.”</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="Valerie June - Call Me A Fool" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-R7hN6bZZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The creation of Valerie&#8217;s songs read like fairytales</strong>. Once upon a time, Valerie was cooking on her cast iron skillet. She’d added in garlic and starting in to chop the onion when she heard a voice singing in time with her knife, “Wanna be on your mind.” Chop. Chop. Chop. “Stay here all the time.”  It was just that fragment of the song but later working in the studio she was able to flesh out the full melody of her hit single “Wanna Be On Your Mind.” A happily ever after, indeed.</p>
<p>That same year, Valerie published her first book of poetry and drawings entitled<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maps-Modern-World-Valerie-Hockett/dp/1524855111/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em> Maps for the Modern World</em>.</a>  She says after her father’s death, she started to hear not only lyrics but also spoken words. She collected hundreds of these lightning bolts and paired them with self-drawn illustrations, “little seeds to keep people’s dreams alive.”<br />

<p>Valerie remains vocal about the purpose of art:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have to be ready as dreamers to go that extra mile. And we need prescriptions ready to go to keep the engine revved. I believe we can create a world of oneness, but I think it’s gonna take a lot of heart and art to get there.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it always helps when you can go to that magical place of creation together with people you trust.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-28225 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-300x300.png" alt="" width="274" height="274" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-300x300.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-150x150.png 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" />This month’s modern-day sirens are known for finishing each other’s sentences as well as falafel. Hailing from the Isle of Wight, an island off the coast of southern England with a population of one hundred and forty-two thousand, Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers are known collectively as the indie-rock band <strong>Wet Leg</strong>. The duo attributes their unique personalities to growing up in the bubble of small island living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main lyricist Rhian is the more outspoken member of the duo, while her counterpart Hester brings whimsy and wisdom to their collaboration. In a mischievous manner, the duo shares several tall tales about the naming of their band. At the time the band was formed both, Rhian and Hester worked full-time jobs, Rhian as a fashion stylist’s assistant and Hester in the family jewelry business. Because music was extracurricular, the pair took their time in selecting a name that would fit their band’s fun and carefree vibe. Hester claims <strong>the band was named from randomly hitting emojis and stumbling on the combination wet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a6.png" alt="💦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />leg <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9b5.png" alt="🦵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />on the emoji keyboard. </strong></p>
<blockquote><p> “We were playing a sort of game where we’d make band names out of different emoji combinations,” Rhian shares in an interview with <em>Vogue</em>. “Then we got to wet leg and it just kind of stuck.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rhian goes on to add, “I think we liked it because it was just such a dumb name for a band. It’s a good reminder to not take ourselves too seriously.”</p>
<p>The second tall tale revolves around Hester. Over the years, she made a name for herself by crafting custom jewelry. You can check out some of her creations here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jewellerybyhesterchambers/">Hester Chambers Jewellery</a>. The story goes that both Rhian and Hester each had one necklace and one read “wet&#8221; the other “leg.” The girls decided to combine the inscriptions. Rhian playfully explains, “<strong>So from that point on the name wasn’t &#8220;set in stone so to speak, but it was definitely set in gold at least.”</strong></p>
<p>The third explanation is perhaps the most inspired. The duo has claimed on several occasions that the band name comes from an<strong> old Isle of Wight phrase for people who come to the island from the mainland (Ovarners) because they will most likely get a “wet leg” crossing the sea for their visit</strong>.</p>
<p>Regardless, when Domino Records questioned the name and asked the pair if they might want to change it, the duo remained resolved. “We stuck by our guns,” Rian shares in a radio interview, adding sarcastically,<strong> “I think it’s important to have trust in your own bad taste, otherwise stuff just gets a bit boring.”</strong></p>
<p>Oozing with tongue-in-cheek humor, the band’s debut single <strong>“Chaise Longue”</strong> went viral in 2021 and was released the same day as a self-directed video featuring the pair in their element on the Isle of Wight. The titled furniture piece featured in the video was owned by Hester’s grandfather. One Christmas, Hester and her boyfriend made up the chaise so that Rhian could sleep over and they ended up writing a song about the piece of furniture.</p>
<p>Written in one day, the catchy chorus borrows lyrics from the 2004 teen comedy <em>Mean Girls </em>asking,<strong> &#8220;Is your muffin buttered?/Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wet Leg - Chaise Longue (Official Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zd9jeJk2UHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the legends surrounding the band’s name, the duo has a similar yarn to spin about how they ended up signing with <a href="https://www.dominomusic.com/uk">Domino Recording Company</a>. Vegans, the duo claim they were won over by the amazing falafel that the record label rep offered them on their first meeting, and that it so surpassed the other recording labels offered that they had no choice but to sign. Their self-titled debut album was released in April of 2021 and seemed to be <strong>just the sort of silly, sarcastic change of pace everyone was needing.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I think generally we write songs expecting them not to be listened to. Maybe that will change,” Hester comments when asked about why they write songs. “I’m quite a lazy songwriter,” she adds before Rhian assures fans that it is Hester’s ability to synthesize that make their duo work.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Every day there’s always something – big things, small things – where we definitely need each other,” Rian shares with NME, before adding, “In a really healthy way, not a creepy way.” In a rare moment of semi-seriousness, Rian reflects,<strong> “I guess being in a band can make or break a friendship but apart from that one time I dropped you and almost broke you, we’re staying solid.”</strong></p>
<p>These sirens growing fan base enjoys not only the playful nature of their lyrics, but the fashion and whimsy of their music videos. <strong>“I used to work as a wardrobe assistant, you can base a whole video around what you are wearing,”</strong> Rhian shares in a recent interview, which is definitely true of “Wet Dream” a breakup song (Salvador Dali inspired, perhaps?) that features lobster claws.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wet Leg - Wet Dream (Official Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjpgJjdk52c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Since moving to London, the duo reports that they’ve spent more time talking about music and less time making it. Their carefree attitudes mean that it’s not about the work it’s about the happiness of experiencing every minute of life. Their music spreads laughter and imagination.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s always good when people get joy from what you make,” Hester softly says. “A little bit of happiness. You don’t want to leave people crying.”</strong>   Be sure to visit <a href="https://www.jambase.com/band/wet-leg">JamBase</a> to check out this band’s upcoming concerts. Oh, and if you&#8217;ve enjoyed these modern-day sirens, be sure to tune in to <a href="https://songshinesounds.com/">Songshinesounds</a> where more musical happiness abounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-28036 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-3-2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This month’s siren spent her childhood wandering the woods of the Pacific Northwest, playing imaginary games and creating fantasy stories. <strong>Michelle Chongmi Zauner, </strong>lead singer, and songwriter of <a href="http://japanesebreakfast.rocks/">Japanese Breakfast Club</a> was born in Seoul, South Korea but grew up in Eugene, Oregon before moving the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to attend <em>Bryn Mawr College</em>.</p>
<p>Because neither of her parents were musical, her tastes bloomed late. In middle school, Michelle was fascinated by Anime films such as <em><strong>Cowboy Beebop</strong></em> and <em><strong>Oh My Goddess</strong></em><strong>!</strong> and their catchy pop arrangements heavily influenced her musical style. It wasn’t until her first guitar at sixteen that Michelle discovered her passion for songwriting.</p>
<p>After writing her first song, she thought, “I’m a genius!” A feeling she continues to chase, although she admits it fades quickly. Songwriting remains a solitary task for Michelle.<strong> &#8220;There&#8217;s a panic that maybe I won&#8217;t be able to create again, and then I discover I can.</strong>&#8221; A cycle she shares in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FaceCulture"><em>FaceCulture</em></a> interview repeats each time she writes a new song. “The first line is the thesis statement of the song.”</p>
<p>Her self-directed video for the song “Everybody Wants to love you” begins with the lines,<em><strong> “Can I get your number?/Can I get you into bed?”</strong></em> Michelle later shares with<a href="https://pitchfork.com/"> <em>Pitchfork</em> </a>that the song was written about her first bisexual relationship.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Japanese Breakfast - Everybody Wants To Love You (Official Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNT7wuqaykc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michelle’s musical career began with a bumpy start. First, she performed under the name<em><strong> Little Girl, Big Spoon</strong></em> in college and then joined the <em><strong>Little Big League</strong></em>, where she spent two years on grueling tours only to return to Oregon unfulfilled when her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Caring for her mother, Michelle started writing and recording under the name <strong>Japanese Breakfast</strong>, a moniker that combines the distinctly American (breakfast) with a culture she heavily identified with because it closely resembled her Korean heritage.</p>
<p>Two months after her mother’s passing in 2014, Michelle started working on her first album, <strong><em>PsychoPomp</em></strong>, the title a reference to a creature that transports the souls of the deceased to the afterlife. To Michelle, the album was an outpouring of feelings she suppressed while she cared for her mother. The album expresses the caregiver&#8217;s perspective that in the end,<strong> “It feels like you lost, some weird battle.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Her debut novel, <a href="https://www.cryinginhmart.com/"><em>Crying in H Mart: A Memoir</em></a> also was inspired by her mother. Michelle was comforted by the food in her local Asian mart. By preparing dishes from her childhood, she felt reconnected to her mother. The novel went on to become a<strong> New York Times Bestseller</strong> and Michelle will be creating the screenplay for the feature film set to be released in the next few years by <em><strong>Orion Pictures</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-28037 aligncenter" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1-300x206.png" alt="" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1-300x206.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To keep her songwriting stimulated, Michelle enjoys creating weird challenges for herself. In June of 2016, for example, she challenged herself to write, record, and release a new song every day. Later, she was able to use this raw material to fuel a new album. “I’m a workaholic,” Michelle confides, “and I work quickly.” In 2017, she released a second album created from old demo songs, which she felt deserved a second chance with a new arrangement.<strong> “I tried to make a nonpersonal album and I failed.”</strong> The melancholic album, <em><strong>Soft Sounds from Another Planet</strong></em> was released a short year after her debut.</p>
<p>Her work habits and challenges are all about staying busy and staying positive. Michelle confides that she tends to <strong>“Err on the side of darkness.”</strong> It’s a constant worry that she will disassociate that keeps her in action. She reflects on the period after her mother&#8217;s death.</p>
<p><em>In some ways, I was a kind of robot cause I felt so devoid of emotion and I spent so much time disassociating from this tragedy that I was really going from day to day robotically.</em></p>
<p>For Michelle, the ultimate euphoria is to have her music put out into the world. In 2021, she released her third album <em><strong>Jubilee</strong></em> which features the song, “Savage Good Boy,” inspired by a headline, <strong>“Billion-dollar Bunker Built for Two.”</strong> Using this headline, she imagined an imbalanced relationship and what might occur to that couple if they were forced into a bunker.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-28039 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1-1-225x300.png" alt="" width="281" height="375" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1-1-225x300.png 225w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture1-1.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></p>
<p>In 2022, Michelle was nominated for two Grammys: Best New Artist and Best Alternative Album. After the show, and snapping a commemorative photo with the Korean boy band <a href="https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/"><strong>BTS</strong></a> to send home to her auntie in South Korea, she headed straight to <a href="https://nathansfamous.com/"><em>Nathan’s Fa</em></a><a href="https://nathansfamous.com/"><em>mo</em></a><a href="https://nathansfamous.com/"><em>us</em></a> for a hotdog and a cold beer. Her Instagram photo depicts the uniqueness that is <strong>Japanese Breakfast</strong><em>, </em>an artist that harnesses every part of her heritage to create new art. By accepting herself, Michele hopes her music and message will inspire other Asian-Americans to put their words out there. Be sure to visit <a href="https://www.jambase.com/band/michelle-zauner">JamBase</a> to catch her in concert this season.</p>

<p>This week’s<strong> Southern Gothic</strong> siren blends the traditions of folk music with contemporary lyrics to create a unique new rock sound. Born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, <a href="https://www.amythystkiah.com/">Amethyst Kiah </a>has spent most of her life east of the Smoky Mountains and a glimpse of them always makes her feel at home. Kiah’s one-of-a-kind style, however, is heavily influenced by her mixed experiences growing up Black and queer in the South.</p>
<p>Her parents bought her first guitar when she was thirteen at which time, she quickly learned her first song, &#8220;<strong>Good Riddance” </strong>by<strong> Green Day.</strong> It wasn’t until Kiah, a predominately self-taught musician, discovered the storytelling power of  <a href="https://toriamos.com/">Tori Amos</a> that she felt inspired to write her own songs. Kiah confesses to her fans, <strong>“</strong><strong>I wanted to be a guitar-playing version of her,</strong>” and as a tribute to this inspiration, Kiah released this month a rock-driven cover of Tori Amos’s song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmRHKYdw5_o">Sugar</a>, which began as a reflection on a lover that didn’t know how much sugar the artist liked in her tea.</p>
<p>An unexpected tragedy, however, struck when Kiah&#8217;s mother drowned in the Tennessee River. Singing at her mother’s funeral was one of Kiah’s first public performances. She shared the impact of her mother’s suicide in an interview with the <strong><em>New York Post.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I interpreted my mom’s suicide as that she didn’t love me and she didn’t want to stick around. I now know that that’s not how suicide works, but I was 17, so my coping mechanism was to keep my distance from people.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The loss of her mother and the spiral of depression would become a major theme in Kiah’s music. In her 2019 Grammy-nominated song,<strong> “Tender Organs,”</strong> Kiah describes her personal struggle with depression and the difficulty she faced in reaching out for help. For Kiah, the song describes her moment of awareness that something was terribly wrong, and in the chorus, Kiah sings, “<strong><em>Notice here, notice here/These tender organs rotting inside me.”</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After her mother’s death, Kiah and her father (who had recently won his own battle with addiction), made a fresh start in Johnson City, Tennessee. That’s when she stumbled on a Bluegrass guitar course at <strong>East Tennessee State University</strong> which kindled a new love of old-time music and the role of Black Americans in country music. “I have a tendency to be really guarded,” Kiah states, confiding that her father’s unwavering support is a crucial part of her success. Growing up, in an all-white suburban area, Kiah recalls frequently being the only Black person in a room. But it was through her music that she came to realize, <strong><em>“I’m not alone on an island. I have a culture. I have a heritage.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Kiah gained confidence in her message as a member of the supergroup, <strong><em>Our Native Daughters</em>.</strong> Formed by <strong>Rhiannon Giddens</strong>, this quartet of Black banjo players, including <strong>Leyla McCalla</strong> and <strong>Allison Russell</strong>, set off on a journey to explore the impact of the transatlantic slave industry and ultimately, to pay tribute to the struggles of Black women throughout history.</p>

<p>In one of the slave cabins the group recorded in, Kiah wrote her hit song,<strong> “Black Myself” </strong>which went on to win a Grammy Nomination for Best American Roots Song in 2019. <strong>“Being in that project is the reason I had the courage to write that song,” </strong>Kiah states, adding: <strong>“I ended up trying to cover 400 years of history in three minutes.”</strong> Quite a feat, which Kiah describes as an “outpouring. Something that needed to take place, even if nobody else liked it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The songs opening lyrics confront the issues of<strong> hypocrisy</strong> and<strong> ignorance</strong> that surround racial prejudice: <strong>“</strong><em><strong>I wanna jump the fence and wash my face in the creek/But I’m black myself. I wanna sweep that gal right off her feet. But I’m black myself.</strong>”</em> Kiah rerecorded the song in 2021, amping up the melody and adding guitar and drums.</p>

<p>Kiah’s journey to find her place in the music industry hasn’t been without moments of uncertainty.  “A couple years using my credit card to buy groceries thinking, I may have to get a full-time job, I can’t do this,” Kiah said. However, her 2021 debut rock album,<strong><em> Wary + Strange </em></strong>proves that perseverance pays off.  Addressing hidden pain, systemic racism, and white supremacy,<strong> <em>Wary + Strange</em></strong> boldly addresses both trauma and triumph.</p>
<p>Kiah’s message is clear: <strong>&#8220;We all have the power to continue to learn from one another and to understand each other and to continue to push for equality for all people</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>&#8220;</strong>  Despite any obstacles, Kiah assures us that she will continue to strive for the greater good, and this is what her music urges each of us to do.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-27370 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-2-300x300.png" alt="" width="294" height="294" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-2-300x300.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-2-150x150.png 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-2.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.waxahatchee.com/">Waxahatchee,</a></strong> the name of the creek behind this modern-day siren’s home in Birmingham Alabama, is also the common thread that runs through her music, tunes that <strong>Katie Crutchfiel</strong>d aka <strong>Waxahatchee</strong> claims follow the traditions of classic Americana songwriters like Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris.</p>
<p>Katie confides that she “<strong>leans on place to lead her </strong><strong>music</strong>.” Weaned on the powerhouse women of Country, Katie and her twin sister, Allison, created music together every day after school. She is vocal about her relationship with her twin: <strong>“One of the most beautiful, creative relationships of my whole life is with Allison. And not because we make music together… but because we kinda make music for each other.”</strong></p>
<p>The twins entered the music scene together under the band name<strong> P.S. Eliot</strong> in the early aughts, a time when punk music wasn&#8217;t the norm for women. Katie shares in an interview with <strong><em>Pitchfork</em> </strong>that the band was a way for the pair to be like, <strong>“We’re going to do everything ourselves, fuck everybody else.”</strong></p>
<p>When <strong>P.S. Eliot </strong>disbanded in 2011, Katie immediately started making music under the name, <strong>Waxahatchee.</strong> And while her first solo album was made in under a week at her parent’s house, her latest albums have been patient projects involving collaboration with other artists.</p>
<p>On the very first day of the Trump administration, Waxahatchee recorded the song <strong>‘No Curse’ </strong>on the documentary series<strong> <em>Shaking Through</em></strong>. She told producers, “Writing lyrics, writing songs has always been the best way for me to process my feelings and emotions.” The song later appeared on Waxahatchee’s fourth album,<strong> <em>Out in the Storm</em></strong><em>, </em>about toxic relationships and standing up to people who don&#8217;t take what you say seriously. Years later, Katie reflects, “It’s an honest and angry album and one that is a product of its time.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Waxahatchee - No Curse | Shaking Through (Music Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdNyo_Q8dqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>By the time Katie finished touring<strong> <em>Out in the Storm</em></strong>, she was struggling to keep her drinking in check. And while she didn’t go to rehab, she did take time off to find other coping mechanisms through self-help and meditation. Katie shared in a recent interview: <strong>“Sometimes you need to struggle to understand where you stand in the world.” </strong></p>
<p>Now 32 years old, Katie’s been sober for three and a half years. <strong>“I really feel like I came back to the person I was before I started drinking,”</strong> she shares with<strong> <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</strong> Her latest album,<strong><em> Saint Cloud</em></strong><em>, </em>is a return to place, this time her father&#8217;s hometown, a small community outside of Orlando Florida, and an album about overcoming addiction and codependency.</p>
<p>She wrote the third track,<strong> ‘Fire’ </strong>on a road trip with her boyfriend, musician <a href="https://www.kevinmorby.com/"><strong>Kevin Morby,</strong> </a>from her hometown of Birmingham to Kansas City. When the couple crossed the bridge into Memphis, Katie claims they entered “<strong>a crazy portal of songwriting magic.” </strong>It was the first time Katie wrote a song without an instrument, and the light on the water created a fire that instantly became the title of this track.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Waxahatchee - Fire (Official Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEyYlyRr2_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Waxahatchee</strong>’s sound has evolved, but for Katie, the song-writing process remains the same: collect tiny bits of sound and sit down to work the pieces like a puzzle. Katie believes <strong>“A song never really feels finished until all the lyrics are in place.” </strong>And five albums later, this modern-day siren continues to show us how to draw on the places of our lives to find inspiration and create meaningful works of art.

					<description><![CDATA[“Optimism and hope can be a really great tether, especially in the troubling times we’ve&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-27167 alignleft" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-1-300x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-1-300x300.png 300w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-1-150x150.png 150w, https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Modern-Day-Sirens-Logo-1.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />“Optimism and hope can be a really great tether, especially in the troubling times we’ve lived through,” says this modern-day siren. “And it’s not necessarily about putting a positive outcome on this future thing, but more about I can do something with the little good I have.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The daughter of Nigerian immigrants, <strong>Joy Oladokun</strong> grew up in Casa Grande, Arizona where she received a steady stream of music from her father’s extensive record collection–think Johnny Cash, King Sunny Adé, and Phil Collins, and a strict religious indoctrination from the Christian church her family regularly attended.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until age ten when she saw Tracy Chapman play at Nelson Mandela’s 70th Tribute Concert that she believed a musical career could be possible for someone of her color.<strong> “Every time I’ve seen a guitar, it has been in the hands of a white person.” Joy recounts</strong>. “[When] I got to see Tracy and her guitar in a stadium of people— just listening to her thoughts, her feelings, how she saw the world— it changed my life.”</p>
<p>With a guitar that she got that Christmas, Joy started to write songs: the first inspired by <strong><em>Lord of the Rings</em></strong> and then many more she shared as a worship leader at her family church, a job she eventually realized was keeping her from happiness and achieving her goals.</p>
<p>“I quit the church and came out of the closet,” Joy recalls. “I got to a point where I was like,<strong> If God exists, he does not care that I’m gay. With all the things happening, he cannot give a shit.”</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, she released her response to these experiences in a single titled<strong> &#8216;Sunday,&#8217;</strong> stating, &#8220;&#8216;This [Sunday] is the song that 12-year-old Joy, seated in the back of church youth group, needed to hear. <strong>She needed to hear that you can be queer and happy. Queer and healthy. Queer and holy. She needed to see married women kissing and playing with their kids.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The video features LGBTQ couples as they grapple with the stigmas of their relationships in the face of religious doctrine. Joy sings, <em>“Sunday, carry me, carry me down to the water/Wash me clean. I&#8217;m still struggling.”</em> <strong>Her song asks the question, how long does it take to undo the stigmas of guilt and shame?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://https://youtu.be/sHbl6zhO3wo">http://https://youtu.be/sHbl6zhO3wo</a></p>
<p>This modern-day siren has had to fight to fuel her dream, raising funds on<strong> Kickstarter</strong> in 2016 to be able to release her debut album, <em><strong>Carry Me</strong></em>. She wrote and recorded all of the songs in her Los Angeles apartment, playing the six different instruments heard on the album.</p>
<p>She has since relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and released two critically acclaimed albums: <strong><em>In Defense of My Own Happiness (The Beginnings)</em> </strong>which was a top 10 best LGBTQ album of 2020, and <strong><em>Defense of My Own Happiness</em></strong> released in July of 2021.</p>
<p>Joy’s music always centers around striking lyrics.<strong> “Words are such a powerful tool,” Joy states. “I love and respect the ability of words to touch on the physical realm.</strong> I’m very intentional with my words.”</p>
<p>Her latest single, <strong>“Keeping the Light On,”</strong> dropped this past January. The song itself is a lifeline for all those trying to see the positive in their current situations. <strong>&#8220;It’s not necessarily about putting a positive outcome on this future thing,” Joy shares, “but more about ‘I can do something with the little good I have.”</strong> Oladokun co-wrote the song with producers Mike Elizondo and Ian Fitchuk, and its down-to-earth lyrics offer practical advice: <em>“Try to give a little/try to be a little/Try to see a light in the dark.”</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Joy Oladokun - Keeping The Light On (Official Lyric Video)" width="730" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s74Gh8eoGe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>“When you listen to me, I want you to feel like you’ve taken an emotional shower,”</strong> Joy shares on her <a href="https://www.joyoladokun.com/">website</a>. “That’s what I’m trying to accomplish for myself. To me, music is a vehicle of catharsis.” She goes on to add. &#8220;I want you to be changed when you hear me, and not because I’m special, but because I make music with the intention to change myself.”</p>
<p><strong>Joy Oladokun’s Spring 2022 North American Tour</strong> kickstarts in Austin, Texas on <strong>April 7.</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.jambase.com/article/joy-oladokun-tour-dates-spring-2022"><strong>Jam Base</strong></a> for a complete list of concerts. This modern-day siren is not shy about her mission: “I feel like it’s not an accident I’m a queer black woman writing and making music,” and her growing fan base whole-heartedly agrees.</p>
