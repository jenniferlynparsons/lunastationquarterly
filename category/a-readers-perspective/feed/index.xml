					<description><![CDATA[When I daydreamed as a child – I imagined myself as a skater wearing fanciful&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I daydreamed as a child – I imagined myself as a skater wearing fanciful sequined skirts with colored laces. I would be the best ice skater there was. During the 4<sup>th</sup> grade, I told my mother that I wanted to cut my long hair – to be like Dorothy – Dorothy Hamill. “You know, the ice skater”.   With my bowl-cut hair, I’d practice jumping from couch to stool landing with one foot, my sisters applauding and scoring me with straight 8’s. Granted, I wasn’t the best at twirling and could barely stand up on skates, but in the eyes of a nine-year-old – I was brilliant.</p>
<p>The sense of freedom I experienced as a child was captured in books as well.   When I first read <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> by C.S. Lewis – I knew that Narnia was real and if I had a giant wardrobe I, too, could escape. Oh, the power we find in books.</p>
<p>It’s nearing the end of January and I look over the list of books I want to read. My count started at 50 and has since been reduce to 30, then 20, then 10. I rounded up to 12 – thinking one a month would be just fine. I suppose the idea of one book a month wasn’t so overwhelming and the urge to finish would be little.</p>
<p>Picking a number was easier then choosing the books. Do I surprise myself and simply wait for the month to arrive and just pick up a book and that becomes the book for that month? Or, do I sort through my stacks and grab random ones? Should I choose a theme? Or, a genre?</p>
<p>For Christmas, I received “Gone Girl” – a book that is definitely outside my genre of sorts. Yet, I felt the need to read it for it was a gift. I decided for the month of January, I’d read it. I’m actually enjoying Gillian Flynn’s writing – she has a nice way about her word choice and the paragraphs flow well. The shift in perspective is refreshing. But, I confessed I cheated and went online to read the ending. Now that I’m half way through the book – I don’t know if I want to finish it. Argh. So does that book count for January? Or am I doomed and need to catch up in February? February is only 28 days – too much pressure already.</p>
<p>Speaking of pressure, do you ever feel the type of book you reading simply is beneath you to read? Do you feel the pressure to read classic books? You know, the ones written in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century early 19<sup>th</sup> in Britain.</p>
<p>My imagined conversation goes like this, “So, tell me what you’re reading”?</p>
<p>“Oh, you know Henry Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> – and you”?</p>
<p>“Me? Well, um, <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>”.</p>
<p>The awkward, pregnant silence moment unfolds and you’re both looking at each other – not quite sure what to say for neither of you of read what the other has and you each think, “Well, at least they&#8217;re reading something”.</p>
<p>Do you have any classics listed in your list of books to read for 2015?</p>
<p>My list…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January</span></strong>: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (Christmas gift)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>February</strong></span>:  Nightmare Magazine edited by John Joseph Adams (Issue 1 | October 2012)  (given as a gift back in 2012 &#8211; I&#8217;m a slacker)</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Shirley Jackson, a short story author, died at an early age of 45. We celebrate&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft" src="https://gradesaver.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/author/image/543/temp_file20141028-16184-1hkzu7s.jpeg" alt="" width="190" height="296" /></p>
<p>Shirley Jackson, a short story author, died at an early age of 45. We celebrate her birthday this month with a tribute to her achievement in writing stories that deal with abnormal psychology and levels of horror.</p>
<p>I love her take on life and on the craft of writing. She wrote, &#8220;I can&#8217;t persuade myself that writing is honest work. It&#8217;s great fun and I love it. For one thing, it&#8217;s the only way I can get to sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson deftly wove a life of tranquility and domestication within her stories &#8211; with an underlying essence of darkness, setting a mood for doom.</p>
<p>In ninth grade, I first read Shirley Jackson as an assignment. Running out of time for my paper, I grabbed the story with the shortest number of pages, Shirley Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;The Lottery&#8221;.  Since then I&#8217;ve been hooked on short stories.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Unknown.jpeg"><img decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-3282 size-full" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Unknown.jpeg" alt="Unknown" width="213" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;The Lottery&#8217; takes you to a small town during the hot part of summer &#8211; an idyllic village where children play, tossing stones to and fro and the parents slowly gathering in the town square for the yearly lottery, slips of empty pieces of paper except for one &#8211; one with a black spot.  For those who haven&#8217;t read the story, it&#8217;s been called, &#8220;one of the most famous short stories in the history of American literature&#8221;.  The New Yorker published the short story in June of 1948 with the greatest outcry from the public, many of whom canceled subscriptions.  When a short story can move individuals &#8211; what an achievement.<a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HauntingOfHillHouse.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-3290 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HauntingOfHillHouse-199x300.jpg" alt="HauntingOfHillHouse" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Although she&#8217;s best known for <em>The Lottery,</em> she&#8217;s also known for dabbling in ghost stories, one of which is considered on the the best literary ghost stories of the 20th century, <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em>. Dr. Montague, an investigator of the supernatural, visits Hill House hoping to prove scientifically the existence of ghosts. He, of course, invites several individuals to the house based on their past paranormal experiences where they shall live in isolation for the summer. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to read the novel, please do.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometime it&#8217;s hard to finish a book especially one that grabs you picking a new one&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-3316 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-22-at-10.04.12-AM-198x300.png" alt="AMOK" width="198" height="300" /></p>
<p>Sometime it&#8217;s hard to finish a book especially one that grabs you picking a new one to read has its worries. What if that new one sucks? What if it&#8217;s so bad&#8230; argh &#8211; it drives me crazy.</p>
<p>I have book piles aligning my stairs, they&#8217;re stacked by genres. Whenever it times to choose a new one, I sit on the landing and perform a debate arguing for each book &#8211; perhaps its something about the cover, or a few words I happen to read, and often it&#8217;s about the books placement grabbing the one at the bottom of the stack &#8211; giving it a win although it say at the bottom. For many reasons, I grabbed <em>Anthology of Asia-Pacific Speculative Fiction </em>book called <em>Amok</em>.</p>
<p>I had just finished reading a story about a mythological foxwife a few months back and the cover by Jun Hun Yap featured a woman with a long red tail that reminded me of a larger size foxwife. I opened the book and had stopped on <em>Where the Fireflies Go </em>and read a few lines &#8211; the word gargoyles jumped from the page. I love gargoyles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="right-image alignright wp-image-3310 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/unnamed-224x300.jpg" alt="gargoyle" width="224" height="300" /></p>
<p>I too, have a gargoyle keeping watch over my place, I gave him the adequate name of &#8216;Mr. Gargoyle&#8217; &#8211; here&#8217;s a snapshot, I was quick and caught him posing with a side tilt of his head, I can never quite get him to turn and look at me directly &#8211; he pretends I&#8217;m not around, such smugness.</p>
<p>I find it interesting how a short story finds you at just the right moment, and <em>Where the Fireflies Go </em>was one of those time. It&#8217;s a tale about Japanese culture surviving in a time where the old traditional practice juxtaposes with the new &#8211; where ceramic creatures take a stand against the &#8220;bone demon&#8221; who has come to consume their master&#8217;s dead body. Although the creatures know the estate will be demolished and all remnants of themselves destroyed their last duty of protection is carried through.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the one of the best little tales in the anthology and in all actuality the only one I read. I put the book back into the stacks &#8211; perhaps at another time, I&#8217;ll grab it to read another.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ghostoria: Vintage Romantic Tales of Fright by Tam Francis Tam Francis writes “vintage romantic fiction”&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Ghostoria: Vintage Romantic Tales of Fright by Tam Francis</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-3033 size-full" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tam_Francis_Author.jpg" alt="Tam_Francis_Author" width="250" height="168" /></strong></p>
<p>Tam Francis writes “vintage romantic fiction” – a collector of anything vintage including patterns, clothing, swing dancing, cooking, sewing, and antiques. “She has published, contributed to and been Editor-in-chief for two indie magazines – <em>From the Ashes</em> (Arts &amp; Literature in the Greater Phoenix area 1990-1994) and <em>Swivel: Vintage Living</em> (swing dancing and vintage lifestyle culture 1994-2000)”. Read more at her <a title="Tam Francis" href="http://www.girlinthejitterbugdress.com/about-tam-francis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<p>Tam Francis is a two-time, National Poetry Slam city finalist, a blogger, short story writer and a first-time novelist. Her short story collection, <em>Ghostoria: Vintage Romantic Tales of Fright</em> is a wonderful collection of tales of ghosts during the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Francis weaves her love of everything vintage into her stories – the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, where times were simpler and courting was an art form.</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Franklin’s Night Out </em>the last story in the collection had won the “Scare the Dickens Out of Us Ghost Story” contest – a beautifully written story about a woman whose encounter with her husband&#8217;s ghost on Halloween evening during a period in history not so long ago.</p>
<p>It is Halloween evening; Mrs. Franklin has tucked her children into bed after an early evening of trick or tweeting. While she waits on a sitter, she preps for her late evening out.   She pines over her lost husband, “She misses him. She misses dancing. She misses dancing with him”. Her best friend wouldn’t be able to make the event and Mrs. Franklin is left alone to attend a Halloween masquerade party.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271714-ghostoria?ac=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-3034 size-full" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ghostoria_Cover.png" alt="Ghostoria_Cover" width="181" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>The scene is set, it’s a rainy night, “Rain streams down the car window. Lightning illuminates the dark avenue in time to see a black cat dart in front of her car”.</p>
<p>What more could we ask for?</p>
<p>Tam Francis’ collection brings a period long forgotten combined with ghostly encounters that makes for a delightful reading.</p>
<p>If you like scary stories “with a little romance and a vintage twist”, I highly recommend Tam Francis’ short story collection, <a title="Amazon - Ghostoria" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Ghostoria-Vintage-Romantic-Tales-Fright/dp/0692264876/ref=la_B00O28WQS0_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413123286&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ghostoria: Vintage Romantic Tales of Fright</em>.</a></p>

<p>By my front door, hangs this quote by Michelangelo, &#8220;I am still learning&#8221;.  I learn by reading and some of the best reads are speculative books &#8211; speculative fiction by female authors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a creator of lists and my most recent list is a collection of last lines from speculative fiction.  I think authors spend such care of summing  up their art with last lines, there is something special about them.</p>
<p>The following are some of my favorite last lines.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite last line?</p>
<p>“He was beginning to be very curious about his future.” &#8212; Lois McMaster Bujold, <em>Memory</em></p>
<p>“I planted it deep in the rick soil of the riverbank. Seconds after I had expelled it, I felt it begin the tiny positioning movement of life.” &#8212; Octavia E. Butler, <em>Imago</em></p>
<p>“We walked hand in hand down the street. When I met my family again, I would introduce them to both of us.” &#8212; Nicola Griffith, <em>Slow River</em></p>
<p>“The bones of things stuck out everywhere. Waves broke in swift lines on the beach, and she walked over the sand toward her friends, in the wind, on Mars, on Mars, on Mars, on Mars, on Mars.” &#8211;Kim Stanley Robinson, <em>Blue Mars</em></p>
<p>“But it’s not now and that’s not my place. This is where I’m standing, on a station between worlds.” &#8212; Karin Lowachee, <em>Warchild</em></p>
<p>“It was the wrong thing to say about an immortal.” &#8212; Helen S. Wright, <em>A Matter of Oaths</em><em> </em></p>
<p>“We dream of carving our dragon.” &#8212; Robin Hobb, <em>Assassin’s Quest</em></p>
<p>“But they never learned what Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which had to do, for there was a gust of wind, and they were gone.” &#8212; Madeleine L’Engle, <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em></p>
<p>“He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.” – Mary Shelly, <em>Frankenstein</em></p>
<p>“He is coming, and I am here.” &#8212; Audrey Niffenegger, <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/600350.Again_Dangerous_Visions?ac=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="left-image alignleft wp-image-2767 " src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Again_Dangerous_Visions_Cover-212x300.png" alt="Again_Dangerous_Visions_Cover" width="142" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>I was reflecting back on speculative fiction and women author&#8217;s in particular and discovered Joanna Russ&#8217;s story of <em>When it Changed</em>, a winner of the 1972 Nebula Award for the Best Short Story. At the time of it&#8217;s writing not many women were writing speculative fiction and the treatment of women characters within science fiction depicted women in stereotypical fashion. Russ writes in the afterword,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I have read Science Fiction stories about manless worlds before; they are either full of busty girls in wisps of chiffon who slink about writhing with lust (Keith Laumer wrote a charming, funny one called &#8220;The War with the Yukks&#8221;), or the women have set up a static, beelike society in imitation of some presumed primitive matriarchy. These stories are written by men. Why women who have been alone for generations should &#8220;instinctively&#8221; turn their sexual desires toward persons of whom they have only intellectual knowledge, or why female people are presumed to have an innate preference for Byzantine rigidity, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Examples of cover images from the 1970&#8217;s reflecting those images.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Infinity_Cover.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2768" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Infinity_Cover-214x300.png" alt="Infinity_Cover" width="168" height="235" /></a>   <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fantastic_Universe_Cover.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2769" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fantastic_Universe_Cover-217x300.png" alt="Fantastic_Universe_Cover" width="170" height="235" /></a>   <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fantastic_Novels_Cover.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2770" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fantastic_Novels_Cover-213x300.png" alt="Fantastic_Novels_Cover" width="168" height="237" /></a>   <a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Forbidden_Planet_Cover.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2771" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Forbidden_Planet_Cover-189x300.png" alt="Forbidden_Planet_Cover" width="150" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to these images and the writings of men, Joanna Russ and several other authors had begun presenting women in a different slant.</p>
<p>With this short story Russ begins to build her foundation to her future novel entitled, <em>The Female Male </em>she wrote in 1975 &#8211; examining women&#8217;s roles from different women narratives each coming from a different societal environment. At the time, considered groundbreaking and ambitious, expanding the science fiction genre and giving women a voice.</p>
<p><em>When it Changed</em> is set on a world called Whileaway where a plague had wiped out men many generations ago. Yet, the planet was on a brink of change when a shipped arrived carrying male astronauts who begin to question Kate the narrator, asking her, &#8220;Where are all the people&#8221;? People referring to &#8216;men&#8217;.</p>
<p>The premise of the story evolves around the idea that a dual-society must exist to ensure the soundness of humanity. The male astronauts see themselves as the authority and the need to perpetuate the human race in order to succeed. This view is thrown into juxtapose against the females whom have existed on Whileaway for 6 generations without males. They have created an existence of duality amongst themselves, without the acknowledgement of males. They see the males as intruders, interlopers, a race that wants to invade and subjugate the females to a role, second cast to them.</p>
<p>The conflict extends with confusion as the males reassure the females that their &#8220;ordeal&#8221; is over, that &#8220;they&#8221; are here to rescue them from their poor existence. The females are initially bewildered and confused &#8211; not understanding &#8216;what&#8217; they need rescuing from &#8211; their society was a way of life with no knowledge of what males are.</p>
<p>The story is relevant today, allowing us to question our preconceived ideas of gender, of roles &#8211; roles that are accepted in today&#8217;s society. It&#8217;s subtlety can be seen from the narrator&#8217;s viewpoint. Initially, the reader perceives the narrator as a male voice for they depict their wife by using the words, &#8220;his wife&#8221;. And its only later we realize that Janet the narrator is in actuality a female acting in the role of a perceived &#8216;male&#8217; or the dual side of the wife.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great read, and allows the author to embrace our preconceived notions and during the 70&#8217;s, I can imagine the responses to Russ&#8217; story were fast and furious. I hope you get a chance to read it.</p>

<p>I like to think that everyone has piles of books – so many books piled high that they begin to slope slightly to the right with the top one that titter slightly whenever you walk by and sometimes at night you here one of those piles crash to the floor.   I woke up last night to the sound of a crash and found my cat, Baby lying across the pile batting at the pages of my most recent finds.</p>
<p>I want to move my piles of book onto shelves, but I struggle with what my personal library should look like. I want the smell of the leather chairs – who doesn’t love that smell. I want shelves of wood – old wood not that new fiberboard – that’s not wood. I want a window to sit by with a round table to hold my cup and room to hold those five books I’ve just grabbed from my shelves.</p>
<p>Does a pile of books constitute a library?</p>
<p>I’ve been searching for bookshelves for the past year. Searching to the point where I’ve become fixated on them. The blog site named <a href="http://www.bookshelfporn.com/">www.bookshelfporn.com</a> is a photo blog of bookshelves for people to indulge in, showcasing the best of the best – pictures of books, bookstores, libraries and bookshelves – a blog that keeps my desire of finding and creating my personal library very much alive.</p>
<p>What does your personal library look like?  I&#8217;d love someone to make mine look like this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cw94-7-14.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="image-left alignleft wp-image-2492 size-medium" src="https://lunastationquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cw94-7-14-194x300.jpg" alt="cw94-7-14" width="194" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/lee_07_14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarkesworld Magazine Issue 94, July 2014</a></p>
<p>I’m still on the folktale mythical search of short stories and came upon <a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/lee_07_14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Contemporary Foxwife</em></a> by <a href="http://www.yoonhalee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoon Ha Lee</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Yoon Ha Lee is a Korean American who grew up in Houston, Texas and writes Science Fiction and Fantasy. She’s written over 40 short stories, some of which have been published in Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, Lightspeed and Clarksworld. She’s adept at weaving meaning into stories and <em>The Contemporary Foxwife</em> is just one example.</p>
<p>The story is a both science fiction and fantasy – a music student on a space station answers the door and finds themselves face to face with a mythical creature that few can see. The creature becomes a live-in maid for Kanseum Ong who has a strained relationship with her father. It’s not until Foxwife disappears does Kanseum realizes how much shes come to rely on him.</p>
<p>It’s a cute story wrapped up in a little neat package with a moral – easy to read and swallow all at once.</p>
