					<description><![CDATA[Great article! FFV does not get nearly as much as love as it deserves. it&#039;s always overshadowed by 4 and 6 ? i liked the more whimsical vibe of 5 esp. since we didnt really see that again until 9. 4 and 6-8 were so heavy. Not everything needs romance!!! (also i love my pirate mom faris). The female representation in FF5 made me feel so special as a kid, when you could only really play as dudes back in the day.]]></description>
