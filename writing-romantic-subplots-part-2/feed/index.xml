					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great post! I&#039;m writing a boook and i have some questions, i hope you can answer.
To your questions at the end of the article:
&quot;Do the story really need it?&quot;
I&#039;m in doubt, about what that actually means. I mean, yes, i could take the romance out of my story, and there would still be a plot, but...
Remove Solangelo from Rick Riordan&#039;s books, and there&#039;s still a plot.
I could remove the characters, and there would still be a plot.
Do you see what i mean?
Is it enough to say &quot;but I want to write a romance subplot&quot;, as answer to the post&#039;s first question? 
I have made the characters (almost) and i would really like to see them come together, but i don&#039;t know what i should answer the question with.

Tak, gracias and danke, for the post and i hope i can get some light on this matter.
I hope i have made my question understandable.]]></description>
