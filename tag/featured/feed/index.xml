										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you hear their thundering hooves? Have you caught a glimpse of a long, spiral horn? If you have, you may have figured out that our December issue has a very powerful theme: Horses!</p>
<p>Horses loom large in our collective histories. Symbols of power, of strength, companions on a long journey, heroes, magical creatures, etc. they’re woven through the fabric of our tales.</p>
<p>All this love of horses is pouring out here and now, the obvious inspiration for this year’s theme. There’s such a wild and varied selection of stories in this issue, tales full of magic and mayhem, court intrigues and cybernetic mounts. And of course, a few unicorns for good measure. It’s nothing less than you might expect from a stories centered on a creature with such presence in the tales we’ve told around a fire for millennia. We hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
