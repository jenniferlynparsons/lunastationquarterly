Thank you for your comment, Shruti!

Right?! It makes me sad because &lt;em&gt;Stalking Jack the Ripper&lt;/em&gt; was such a great series starter and I hoped for the same with this. At least you and I are on the same page, and hopefully the next in the series will be better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree with this article. What&#039;s even more funny is that I still didn&#039;t know that the book was set in the 19th Century. I got to know through this review and now I&#039;m even more confused. It&#039;s such a simple book but I still don&#039;t know what exactly I read.]]></description>

I&#039;m so relieved you feel the same!! I&#039;m really hoping the new setting will be immersive, and the relationships will give that Thomas-and-Audrey energy I was looking for in KotW!]]></description>

Lisa,
Thank you so much for your comment and I&#039;m terribly sorry about my delayed response!

I ate up her first series too - and I&#039;m happy to hear we were on the same page about the world-building. You and I both are looking forward to meeting all the brothers in KotC... we&#039;ll have to circle back around and have another conversation when it releases!

PS - you broke my heart a little with that last sentence, HPD was my favorite of the series!! But I won&#039;t hold it against you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I gobbled up the entire Jack the Ripper series on a co-worker&#039;s recommendation and eagerly jumped into Kingdom of the Wicked without giving it much thought. I was totally expecting to enter a world that felt as well-defined and thoroughly researched as the author&#039;s previous works, so I&#039;m gratified to hear I wasn&#039;t the only one confused by this novel&#039;s sketchy setting and loosely-defined time period. I also seem to have missed certain significant plot twists while reading -- like how Pride suddenly became the main demon everyone was catering to, and why Vittoria felt like she needed a day job serving drinks in a pop-up casino. I had a lot of fun imagining how Sloth and Gluttony would show up in the story -- maybe I was projecting my personal COVID experience -- so I truly hope we get to meet the entire sinful brotherhood when we follow Emilia on her road trip to hell. Anyway, I was marginally disappointed by this book -- sort of how I felt while reading Hunting Prince Dracula -- but have high hopes that Kingdom of the Cursed will come back strong.]]></description>

Thanks for your comment! I&#039;m so glad to hear you enjoyed it!

I agree, definitely something bigger at play. I think the way their relationship &quot;reset&quot; unsettled me the most, in addition to the whole book feeling like a &quot;lead up&quot; (to me). 

I hope to like the second in the series more! Thanks again for your comment and have a wonderful rest of your day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finished reading it yesterday. I really enjoyed it but was a bit confused at the end. It seemed like Wrath was trying to help her before he was killed, and then when he came back again, he was like when they first met. It didn&#039;t seem like he would betray her by this point, so I am wondering if thete is a bigger scheme at play. ]]></description>
