					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Erika Carlevarino: “During the pandemic, I have been contacted to create characters for a film in stop motion in Peru. I&#8217;m still working on the creation of characters, it&#8217;s a first phase and it&#8217;s not final, but I&#8217;m very excited to participate in such a project. Meanwhile, I continue with my fantastic creatures and colored lamps.” Erika is constantly adding new dolls to her Etsy shop, The Elven Refuge.
