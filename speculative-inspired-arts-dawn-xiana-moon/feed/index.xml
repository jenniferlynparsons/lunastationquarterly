					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Dawn Xiana Moon: “This has been a weird year for art. Britain&#8217;s Got Talent flew me to London in January—I performed as the Bellydancing Wookiee—but by the time my segment aired in May, the world had locked down and live performance and international travel had ceased to be viable. So I&#8217;ve been producing and performing in livestream shows. At this point Raks Geek and Raks Inferno have done 10 virtual productions of firespinning, bellydance, and circus with performers from around the country &#8211; we&#8217;ve even done private events for big corporate clients. (Hire us to entertain your company online!) I&#8217;m also producing a virtual festival featuring Asian-American artists (Defiant Silk Bellydance Festival) that will be coming in January.” You can watch Raks Geek’s latest public livestream shows here: https://www.facebook.com/raksgeek/live_videos [&#8230;]]]></description>
