					<description><![CDATA[&quot;However, the amount of aroace characters in SFF is shockingly low. I know of only two.&quot;

Ooh, which two are these? (Katherine in Dread Nation is one? which I have not read yet). Also, pretty much since I can remember, I&#039;ve been drawn to certain stories with little to no romantic subplots, so I appreciate this list and will check up on these recs. 

I&#039;ve recently finished Network Effect by Martha Wells. I enjoy the entire Murderbot series, starting with All Systems Red, which is sci-fi with little/no romantic subplot.

There&#039;s Seanan McGuire&#039;s Wayward Children series, most of which fit this, I think. Every Heart a Doorway features Nancy, an asexual character (explicitly stated, but romantic orientation not specified, I think, if I recall correctly). 

And Binti, by Nnedi Okorafor. Blood Child collection of short stories by Octavia E. Butler. The Haunting of Tram Car 015 by P. Djeli Clark. Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir didn&#039;t have much. The Library of the Unwritten by AJ Hackwith had none. The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal. I think I&#039;m sometimes drawn to short story collections for this reason too and read plenty of those.]]></description>
