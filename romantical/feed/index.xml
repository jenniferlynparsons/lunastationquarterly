					<description><![CDATA[Even among the strongest sci-fi/fantasy epics I&#039;ve read, romance has played a part in some way. Even if it&#039;s not a primary or secondary plot, it shapes and defines the characters. What are the influences being exerted on a person? What motivates them? How far will they go to get/protect/make happy/rescue the ones they love? It connects the reader to and humanizes the characters in ways romance free stories just can&#039;t achieve. 

I mean, would Westley have ever become the Dread Pirate Roberts without the love of his Buttercup - who he surely must return to - sustaining him? I daresay not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen, Sister!! I agree that there is a &#039;love potion&#039; mixed into every format that we watch. It is the rare Hero&#039;s Journey film that we watch that does not include some form of romance (or bro-mance). 
Personal favs are always the Jane Austen films, but love the book &#038; movie &quot;Possession&quot; 2002, novel by A.S. Byatt - romance in the present &#038; the past, and treasure hunt with adventure! Two past favorite films (when I am feeling low) are Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; with Madonna and &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; with Sandra Bullock. The heart seeks companionship and that comes in many forms, many expressions, and from a variety of personalities. How could we limit/restrict/condemn this lovely element in our lives?
Excellent article - Thank you for stating the obvious!]]></description>
