					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tracy, LSQ asked me to join their blogosphere, so I was checking it out. This post is as deeply smart as it is smartly written. This point in particular was eye opening: &quot;With rare exceptions, this sci-fi shorthand has taught viewers to see natural spaces, organic lines, and bursts of physical color as primitive. Indeed, ‚Äútech-washing‚Äù is as real as whitewashing in sci-fi storytelling. When deployed within narratives meant to represent a minority perspective and experience, it can be similarly damaging.&quot; Great link to Ebony&#039;s article on Afrofuturism, too.  Very impressed.]]></description>
