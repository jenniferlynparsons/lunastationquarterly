					<description><![CDATA[This seems kinda weird tbh. I&#039;m all for being inclusive, but saying crap like guy DMs tend to have &quot;continuous HULK-SMASH battles&quot; is blatantly sexist. Feminism, as I understand it, is equality for all. You shouldn&#039;t disparage male DMs, let alone male players, for that. We shouldnt try to convince peeps to go for male or female characters regardless of the group, and we sure as hell shouldn&#039;t only focus on the idea of *only* respecting women.

We shouldnt relate dnd to the real world in my opinion. If a straight white guy wants to play a gay black guy without being offensive, whats wrong with it? It&#039;s a game at the end of the day, and shouldn&#039;t have repercussions in real life if your being a good person bout it.

Equal chance to play, equal respect for all, and equal love for this awesome game. That&#039;s how it should go. Not favoring one side over another. Especially with how dnd has become so much more diverse, with the idea of it being dominated by cis white males out the window a long time ago.]]></description>
