well, my main topic of research is ancient greece, so that&#039;s what i&#039;m going from. we used to have annual cyclical festivals where grief was ritually expressed. it was almost a form of practice, so that when a personal grief arrived as it inevitably does, there was a framework in place to guide one through it. the methods would vary, for example wandering and mourning were a facet of the Greater Eleusinian Mysteries, followed by ribald jesting. at the Adoneia women threw pottery from the rooftops, the shattering symbolizing the loss of the youth and vitality of the young men (presumably in warfare.) the Bacchic Mysteries involved rending, keening, and dancing to exhaustion. 
today, other than stories, we have little that prepares us for grief until it flattens us.

					<description><![CDATA[because we no longer have mourning rituals in our society, fiction is often the only way we have to confront and explore it other than going through it ourselves. from that perspective a well-written death scene has a societal impact beyond just being a good read. i&#039;m grateful to authors who do a good job of tackling the subject.
