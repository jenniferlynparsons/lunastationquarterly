					<description><![CDATA[Dear M.M. Justus - may I call you M&#038;M?

I enjoyed reading the interview with Ms Van Camp, I had the strangest impression of looking through the leaves of an overhanging tree and watching someone doing nothing in particular but being quite content in whatever it was. She probably didn&#039;t even realize she was humming to herself. Yes, I enjoyed reading about you.

Good luck.]]></description>
