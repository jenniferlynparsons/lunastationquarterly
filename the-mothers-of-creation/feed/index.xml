					<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful trip through the past! I loved Cleary&#039;s books, devoured nearly every Nancy Drew thanks to older cousins who sent their copies my way, but I don&#039;t remember The Poky Little Puppyâ€¦although the cover gives me goosebumps of recognition for some reason:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I loved the Beverly Cleary book! And Nancy Drew -- I think I must have ready all those at least two or three times. My mother read to me all the time. In fact, I don&#039;t really remember learning to read, because I just sort of picked it up from following along as my mother read to me. Thanks for the trip down Memory Lane!]]></description>
