  <p>We&apos;re still figuring out where the blog archives will live. We hope to make them available again as soon as we can.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed a few changes to the site, particularly around how we&apos;re now presenting our issues. There are some really, really good reasons for that.</p>
  <p>The very short answer is: We want to protect our people so they can write the stories they want to tell and treat their work with the respect they deserve. Touch grass not algorithms. Be authentic to who you are. Be human.</p>
