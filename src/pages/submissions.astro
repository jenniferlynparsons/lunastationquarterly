  <h3 class="font-normal font-sans text-2xl m-0 pb-7">
    We're currently open for submissions. Our next submission period closes on August 15th.
  </h3>
  <h3 class="font-normal font-sans text-2xl m-0 pb-7">Criteria</h3>
  <p>
    Luna Station Quarterly publishes speculative fiction written by women-identified authors. We think women write
    awesome characters and really cool stories and we want to show it to the world. We will consider stories submitted
    by any woman writer, regardless of experience or writing resume. If you consider yourself on the woman end of the
    gender spectrum in any significant capacity, you&apos;re welcome here!
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-normal font-sans text-2xl m-0 pb-7">Stuff we want:</h3>
  <ul class="marker:text-lsq-black">
    <li>Fantasy</li>
    <li>Science Fiction</li>
    <li>Space Opera</li>
    <li>New Fairy Tales (<strong>not retellings</strong>)</li>
    <li>Some creepiness</li>
    <li>Stories that explore the nooks and crannies of an original world</li>
    <li>Big events from the everyman perspective</li>
    <li>Unique settings and storytelling forms</li>
    <li>Well written stories with strong characters</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-normal font-sans text-2xl m-0 pb-7">Stuff we don&apos;t want:</h3>
  <ul class="marker:text-lsq-black">
    <li>Anything biased toward any religion, race or moral preference</li>
    <li>
      Extreme gore or sexual content, in particular <strong>no explicit rape or sexual assault</strong>. (everything in
      moderation)
    </li>
    <li>Bizarro fiction</li>
    <li><strong>Poetry</strong></li>

    <li>Plagiarism</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>A further note about sex and violence in submissions.</strong>
    <br />
    Science fiction has a long-standing tradition of pushing boundaries and asking difficult questions. It is meant to challenge
    us and ask us to look at ourselves and how we treat each other and the world around us. That said, LSQ is centered on
    uplift and so any story that contains explicit sexual situations or violence especially toward women will be considered
    more carefully than other stories and the content must be justified within the story&apos;s plot.
  </p>

  <h3 class="font-normal font-sans text-2xl m-0 pb-7">Format and Details</h3>
  <p>
    Stories should be 500 to 7000 words in length. We may publish longer or shorter works, but the greater your story is
    above or below limit, the less likely we are to publish it. No poetry please.
