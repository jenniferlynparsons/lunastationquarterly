short_bio: Tina’s career includes a published novel titled The Corsican, a trunk novel
  with more revisions than a hydra has heads, a promising, soon to be published novel
  called Bento Box. She also has two published short stories, “The Gaijin and the
  Butterfly” and “Bits & Pieces.” She’s bootstrapped her way up from a novice to her
  current position with a lot of hard work and fun, and loves telling stories more
  than anything. She’s married and has a son, who are her most avid (and critical!)
  audience.
