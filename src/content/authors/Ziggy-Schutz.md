Ziggy Schutz (she/him/he/her) is a queer, disabled, proud previvor mess who is at all times looking for ways to make his favorite fairytales and horror stories reflect people who look a little more like her.

Ziggy is the writer and creator of Crossing Wires, a hopeful post-apocalyptic podcast, as well as having over 25 short stories and such published. His first novella, twice spent comet, was released in December of 2024. If you're a fan of space mermaids and found family, maybe check it out.
