short_bio: Wanda was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. She attended the University
  of Missouri - Kansas City where she should have graduated with a B.A. in English,
  but instead changed majors to Communications - Media Production. It did not pay
  off. Currently she works as a freelance copywriter, video production specialist
  and is teaching herself computer programming. She's also looking forward to begin
  writing again. It's been a while and she misses it.
