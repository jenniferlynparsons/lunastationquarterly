Before Sarah Newman could even properly hold a writing instrument she would record stories on her Fisher-Price tape recorder. Her love for story grew and she went on to study Dramatic Writing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.

Sarah writes TV pilots, screenplays, and short fiction. She's a coach for an online writing circle where she works with writers to develop and sustain a productive writing practice and overcome creative blocks.

Sarah lives in New York City and can be found wandering around snapping photos of whatever catches her eye or reading in the tranquil community gardens.

You can find Sarah chatting about writing as @SarahAlexis4 on Twitter and posting writing-related photos (that showcase her notebook addiction) as @WriteCreateBe on Instagram.
