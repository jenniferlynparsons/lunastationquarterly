short_bio: A graduate of Bryn Mawr College (with the ever-useful Russian Literature
  degree) and UCLA (with a Masters in Library Science), Andrea Hull once believed
  it was a matter of course that someday a dragon would swoop out of the sky and carry
  her off. She remains disappointed. At any one time, she is on one of two continents
  that are not North America, has two children, a wonderful man, and the ever-present
  dread of climate change looming large over everything and making her want to sink
  into a deep sofa and never leave it. Otherwise, she is generally quite cheerful.
