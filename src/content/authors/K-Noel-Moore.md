Born in Nashville, raised outside Atlanta, and currently a full-time college student in Carrollton, GA, K. Noel Moore has been writing fiction for as long as she could properly hold a pencil; she has experimented with most genres and various lengths, but her favorite things are short stories that explore themes like gender variance, redemption, mental health, and death, through the lens of the supernatural. She is the author of one book, Undertown, and is hard at work on her second; Luna Station Quarterly Issue 037 is her fifth short story publication.

K. Noel is pursuing an ASL interpreter certificate, and is an ardent advocate for disabled acceptance and rights.
