Imelda holds a Masters degree in English Literature with an emphasis in heroism and narrative. Her interests relate to the power of narrative in storytelling: how stories within mythology, fairytales, and legends, from different cultures and time periods, written or spoken, are all interrelated on the basis of human experiences. She primarily writes stories that portray the archetypal hero’s journey as she believes the journey of the hero is the journey of what it means to be human. She received her B.A. in English with a minor in Classical Studies while also swimming competitively as a Division I athlete. Currently, she teaches intro Communication and English courses, coaches young swimmers, and eagerly contributes to Finding the Fantastic Podcast and Luna Station Quarterly Blog.
