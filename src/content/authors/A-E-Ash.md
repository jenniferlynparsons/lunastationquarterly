short_bio: Once upon a time there was a nerd who wrote books and poems about magic,
  mayhem, pew-pew and space and she lived awesomely ever after with her hubby and
  only mildly nefarious felines.

A.E. Ash is a writer, nerd, gamer, mooncalf but not a baker or candlestick maker (and nobody said anything about butcher). She writes poetry and speculative fiction because why not make good use of an over-active imagination? Ash lives in the U.S. with her super-rad husband and nefarious felines who do nothing at all to help her achieve world domination. She is a graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop but the most valuable lessons she has learned about writing she’s begged, borrowed, and stolen from the weirdness of everyday life. You can find her on Twitter at @dogmycatzindeed or on her blog, www.aeashwrites.wordpress.com.
