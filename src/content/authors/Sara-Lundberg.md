Sara E. Lundberg is a freelance editor and a dabbling writer. She earned a bachelor’s degree in Creative Writing from the University of Kansas and a certificate from the Professional Sequence in Editing program at UC Berkeley. She was an editor and contributor for two years at the Confabulator Café, a website she co-founded with other members of her writing group. She specializes in editing genre fiction and has worked with many local authors of various projects. Her favorite genre to read is urban fantasy, but she’ll devour anything you put in front of her. Not only is she an avid reader, she also writes when the stars align. She participates in National Novel Writing Month every year and has been the Lawrence, KS Municipal Liaison for the last six years.
