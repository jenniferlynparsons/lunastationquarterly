Chloe Smith teaches English and history to 14-year-olds, which is never boring. Besides teaching, she works as a proofreader for Fantasy magazine, and writes science fiction and fantasy stories whenever she can make the time. She was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and she lived in Texas and Washington states, New York City, and rural France before coming back to California. Her short fiction has appeared in Metaphorosis, Three-Lobed Burning Eye, Interzone Digital, and elsewhere. Her debut novella, Virgin Land, came out from Luna Press Publishing in 2023.
