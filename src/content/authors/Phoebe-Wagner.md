short_bio: Phoebe Wagner cannot imagine moving to Mars because she still hasn't adjusted
  to living in Iowa (like Mars, there is no water and no trees). She is a student
  in the MFA in Creative Writing and the Environment at Iowa State University. Her
  work can be found at Rose Red Review, Vine Leaves Literary Journal, and Hearth Magazine.

Phoebe Wagner grew up in Pennsylvania, the third generation to live in the Susquehanna River Valley. She spent her days among the endless hills, and while she is still getting used to the flatness, Iowa does have its charms. She graduated with a B.A. in English: Creative Writing from Lycoming College where she also met her husband. Phoebe writes primarily fiction but explores poetry and creative nonfiction as well. Her interests revolve around mythology, fantasy, and science fiction, focusing on finding wonder where others have forgotten to look. Her work has appeared in Vine Leaves Literary Journal, Hearth Magazine, Rose Red Review, and The Allegheny Review.

While Phoebe has worked as a college admissions counselor, street artist, graphic designer, theatre box office manager, and barista, her writing remains one of the few constants in her life. When not reading or writing, she enjoys weekend adventures with her husband, kayaking, literature discussions over a pint of craft beer, and playing with her cat Mithrandir.
