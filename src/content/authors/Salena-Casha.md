From Massachusetts, Salena Casha is primarily a children's, middle grade, and young adult author represented by Carolyn Jenks of the Carolyn Jenks Agency. She lived in eight places in the US and abroad before she turned eleven and has since continued to travel around the globe. Her writing has appeared in over thirty publications and her short story, "Otherland" first published by The Adroit Journal, was nominated for Best Undergraduate Writing. She was a 2013-2014 finalist for the Boston Public Library's Children's Writer-in-Residence and a 2011 scholarship recipient in fiction at the Bread Loaf Writers Conference in Middlebury, VT. Her first three picture books were published by MeeGenius Books! and currently, her picture book "Nuwa and the Great Wall" is a PBS Kids Summer Learning Project ebook for the summer. As of late, her writing engages with modern re-tellings of Japanese and Chinese mythic lore and she is an avid reader of science fiction, fantasy and literary works. In her "real" life, she edits calculus and advanced math textbooks for Pearson.
