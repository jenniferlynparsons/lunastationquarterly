short_bio: Mab Morris has published three books in fantasy and fantasy-mystery. She
  is becoming known for her world building. As Jane Lindskold wrote, 'The greatest
  strength of Fate of the Red Queen is its world-building, from which both plot and
  characters arise organically.' This short story stands on it's own, an imagined
  reality that may or may not come after this novel--with an incredibly strong woman.
  It shares a reality that comes far too close for far too many women, of harassment
  and misogyny and one the author struggles to understand. All she can say is, 'Be
  at peace, good soul.'

Mab Morris is becoming known for the world building in her novels, as well as unique characters and interesting plots. She borrows from mythos and histories from varied parts of our rich world, creating new cultures for her characters to live, love, talk to demi-gods, and die. Not limiting herself to her own books, Mab Morris has been part of the publishing industry since 2003, in various ways—indexing, formatting, copy editing, fact checking, and more. Her great love is doing substantive editing, and she has re-opened her editing business White Tiger Literary. She also offers a one on one writing or creative retreat. A first generation American, she grew up in a household that celebrated not the divisiveness, but the multi-cultures of South Africa long before the end of apartheid. They’d eat Indonesian, Dutch, German, and French cuisine against a backdrop of African art and European tapestries. Inspired by our world, book by book, she has been building the multi-culture planet Ihyel—so coining the idea of “culture crafting” as she builds a new planet for readers to explore.
"The greatest strength of Fate of the Red Queen is its world-building, from which both plot and characters arise organically. This is not a story that could take place anywhere except for the Jungle of the Dead and its environs. Fate of the Red Queen is a quietly compelling book that rewards the reader by providing answers to elements that seem impossibly contradictory at the tale's start, but prove to be the heart of a mystery equal parts sacred and tragic"—Jane Lindskold. Changer, Through Wolf’s Eyes, Artemis Awakening, Asphodel… and many more!
Morris's worldbuilding, with its intricacy and its sensitivity to anthropological and mythological detail, inevitably reminds one of Ursula LeGuin.—Kathryn Hinds, The Healer's Choice
"Mab Morris is a fantasy author extraordinaire. A master world-builder, her work will transport you to realms you thought lived only in your dreams and nightmares, and she is as comfortable orchestrating epic battles as she is dissecting the inner lives of her characters."—Layton Green, author of The Blackwood Saga
