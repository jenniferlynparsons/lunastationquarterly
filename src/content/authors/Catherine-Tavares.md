Catherine Tavares is a Science Fiction/Fantasy author living in the golden state of California where she braves earthquakes, wildfires, and unaffordable everything for the promise of mild winters, relaxing beaches, and really good food.
She graduated from West Valley College and San Jose State University with AA and BA degrees in English and Creative Writing and has since put them to use to publish flash and short fiction. Her work has appeared in Daily Science Fiction, After Dinner Conversation, the Santa Clara Review, and multiple cycles of F(r)iction’s Dually Noted. It includes fan favorites such as “I Met Her in the Aspen Grove” and “Her Solemn Duty” as well as the much-discussed “Echo.”
Jenna’s delight in speculative fiction started way back in the day with Tolkien’s The Hobbit and hasn’t seen fit to stop since. She can frequently be found perusing bookstores for new reads and spends much of her time badgering her local library with purchase requests or stalking their catalog to secure the number one hold slot on her finds.

When not reading or writing, Jenna enjoys casually playing video games, struggling to knit, and discovering new recipes.
