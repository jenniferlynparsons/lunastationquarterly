short_bio: SK Marre is a Connecticut based author and photographer. When she isn’t
  writing magazine articles about the best shutter speeds to capture a sunset, she’s

  or working on her fiction. SK has short stories and flash fiction in Havok Publishing
  (previously Havok Magazine), Unfortunately, Literary Magazine, and History Through
  Fiction.
