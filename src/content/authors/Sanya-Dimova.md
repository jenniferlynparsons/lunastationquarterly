Sanya Dimova is a Bulgarian witch roaming the city of Paris with her muggle husband and two canine familiars. When she's not casting curses on French frogs, you can find her writing fantasy, horror, and sci-fi by night, and a different kind of speculative fiction by day (software marketing copy). Her stories have appeared in Elegant Literature, Crepuscular Magazine, and Fraidy Cat Quarterly, among others.
