My name's Kiana Danielle and I'm a English Literature and Film student at the University of South Florida. When I'm able to break away from studying you'll probably find me writing fiction, sketching cartoons or geeking out about the incredible storytelling in today's television (I see you The Leftovers).

For now you'll only be able to find my writing on Luna Station Quarterly - and TeenInk's magazine if you dig hard enough.
