Kit Morgan is a speculative fiction writer who lives on Kaurna land in Australia. After moving up from the countryside to chase a lifelong dream of being an author, Kit spent a few years studying creative writing. Now they are hard at work on projects between video games, camping, and getting through must-see-before-you-die movie lists.
'Elixir of Life' is Kit's first published work.
