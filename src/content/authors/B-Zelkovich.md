B. Zelkovich writes Speculative Fiction, anything from dragon hunting and space whales to demon-dealing and ghost tales. She likes to explore human emotions in very inhuman situations. When she isnâ€™t escaping through her imagination, she escapes into the wonders of the Pacific Northwest with her spouse and their four-legged son, Simon.

Her fiction is in the anthologies Beyond & Within: Folk Horror Short Stories, Saltwater Sorrows, and Life Beyond Us, as well as Wyldblood Flash and Luna Station Quarterly. She is a recent graduate of the Viable Paradise Workshop. Connect with her online at bzelkovich.com.
