Nikki Kroushl (sometimes writing as Nicole Crucial) is a graduate of UNC Wilmington's BFA program in creative writing. Much like a houseplant, she loves sunlight, the indoors, astrology poems, and when the cat sits next to her on the window sill. Her fabulist fiction, self-indulgent essays, and occasional rogue poem appear in Diabolical Plots, Zizzle Literary, mutiny!, Runestone Literary Journal, and other places.
