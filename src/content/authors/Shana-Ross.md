Shana Ross bought her first computer working the graveyard shift in a wind chime factory, a beloved HP whose hard drive resides in her basement with a number of early works. Her writing career has been long dormant for reasons both practical and best discussed in therapy, but she has authored a respectable living as a consultant, executive coach, and global leadership expert. Recently, she dyed her hair purple and is starting to turn that all around. Since 2018, her work has appeared in over a dozen publications, including Anapest Journal, Anatolios Magazine, Apricity Press, Chautauqua Journal, Ghost City Review, The Hellebore, Indolent Pressâ€™ What Rough Beast project, Mad Scientist Journal, metafore, SHANTIH Journal, Street Light Press, The Sunlight Press, Unlikely Stories, Voice of Eve, and Writers Resist.
