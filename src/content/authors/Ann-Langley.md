Ann Langley is a speculative fiction writer living and working in the wilds of western New Jersey. She has studied Fine Art, Education, Reading, and numerous other topics. She has several degrees and currently spends her days teaching Language Arts and History to young students; she spends her nights writing short stories, poetry, novels, and occasionally erotica.

A practitioner of yoga, mindful meditation, and occult arts, Ann believes deeply in the power of the mind to shape reality. Her writing draws on fairy tales and myth, and she utilizes form and perspective as tools to challenge the storytelling form. She is fascinated by classical monsters & villains, overlooked female characters, dead languages, and alternative ways to tell stories.  In addition to blogging about writing and life at Luna Station Quarterly, she is the moderator of the Book Club at the online writing community getyourwordsout.
