Olga Kolesnikova was born in the same city as one of Russia's most violent serial killers, and now lives in the same city that was once home to an Archbishop of Canterbury. Literature has always been one of their passions, and they studied Creative Writing and English Literature at Kingston University London, achieving First-Class Honours and taking the Creative Writing MA the following year, graduating in 2018. Their debut poetry pamphlet, 'Chronicology', which explores the topic of pain, was published by Sampson Low in the same year. Since then, Olga has quietly written one and a half novels, as well as a handful of short stories and an armful of experimental poetry. Olga identifies as a nonbinary woman, mainly but not exclusively using they/them pronouns. They are proudly neurodivergent and proudly bisexual.
