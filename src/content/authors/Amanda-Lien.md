Amanda Lien (she/her) is a freelance PR writer and editor, MFA student, and speculative fiction writer based in Philadelphia, PA. While earning her MFA from National University, her scholarship focused on the validity of fanfiction in composition pedagogy, and on exploring the ways in which speculative fiction and chronic illness can – and should – intersect. When she's not writing original fiction or her thesis, you can find her reading or writing fanfiction, beating her sister in Mario Kart 8, or watching her comfort movie, Mad Max: Fury Road.
