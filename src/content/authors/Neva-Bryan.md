She describes her writing as Appalachian Gothic. With a focus on landscape and environment, culture, and social issues, her work features elements of horror, science fiction, fantasy, and crime.

Her literary influences include Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson, Stephen King, Ron Rash, Silas House, Alice Hoffman, and Flannery O’Connor.

She received a Bachelor of Arts in Foreign Affairs from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and a Master of Professional Writing from Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

Neva has given readings and led workshops at the Southern Literary Festival, Virginia Writers Club Symposium, Roanoke Regional Writers Conference, Appalachian Studies Association Conference, Southern Appalachian Writers Cooperative Gathering, Appalachian Writers Workshop, and the Appalachian Writers Association Conference. In addition, she has worked frequently with public libraries and schools to provide readings and workshops for children and young adults.

She lives with her husband and a redbone hound in the mountains of Virginia.
