short_bio: I am a Neuroscience student with three cats and too many books and I hope
  to get more of both. Since reading minds and teleportation aren't possible yet,
  writing about them is one of my favorite things to do in the meantime. I live in
  the land of Venus flytraps and wait for the snow to come.
