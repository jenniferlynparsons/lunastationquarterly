Miranda Geer is a college freshman who eats far too many Oreos for her own good. She has been reading and writing speculative fiction in her spare time since childhood, and her heroes include Ray Bradbury, Connie Willis, Richard Heinlein and Tim Powers. Currently a part-time college tour guide and full-time student, she also spent several years working as a birthday party coordinator at the awesome but little-known Peoria Zoo. Miranda is a Christian and aspires to become a middle school literature teacher.
