Nadia Attia is a London-based journalist and film/TV script reader, who also works as an Editor and Copywriter. In 2017 she completed a Curtis Brown novel-writing course, and she's had short stories published in the City of Stories anthology and in Star Songs (bedtime stories), and is shortlisted for the 2019 FAB prize. In 2019 she also won a free place at a writing retreat, in a house that inspired Wuthering Heights. She continues to build her gothic short story collection and has just started her next novel, a road-trip packed with folk horror-magic realism. She loves folklore, fairy tale and all things supernatural.
Her short story Flower, Feather, Hare and Snow was inspired by Nan Shepherd's wonderful book The Living Mountain.
