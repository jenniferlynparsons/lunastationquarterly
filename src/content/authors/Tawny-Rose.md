My name is Tawny Rose, and I've been breathing the sea salt air of the Pacific Northwest my entire life â€” I was born and raised in Seattle, and I still call it home. I love fiction in all its various forms, but speculative fiction is especially thrilling. I'm so excited to be working with Luna Station Quarterly to amplify voices of women writers!
