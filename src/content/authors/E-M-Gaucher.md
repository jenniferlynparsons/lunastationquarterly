short_bio: E.M. Gaucher lives in Kelowna, BC with two daughters, two dogs, and a husband.
  She has a degree in English from UBC and works as a technical writer, but fiction
  is her passion and she's currently working on her debut SFF novel. When she's not
  writing, working, or wrangling her human/animal menagerie, she's either reading
  novels at an alarming frenetic pace or re-playing the Mass Effect trilogy for the
  umpteenth time.
