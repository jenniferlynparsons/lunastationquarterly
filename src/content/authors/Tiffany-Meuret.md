Tiffany has been creating stories about monsters and women and monster women since childhood, with no inclination of stopping. She's served as an editor for the Women's Fiction Writers Association, slush reader for local literary magazines, and a guest blogger. Her work is published or forthcoming with Martian, Four Chambers Press, Collective Unrest, MoonPark Review, and others. She wears entirely too much snake jewelry on any given day. Find her online for a chat or for extremely opinionated political rants.
