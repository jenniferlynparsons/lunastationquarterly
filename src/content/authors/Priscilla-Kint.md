Priscilla Kint (she/her) is the author of “The Legend of Emma Sondheim”. She writes Young Adult stories that usually involve time travel, a hint of magic, and confused but headstrong teenagers.
In 2015, she did a minor in Creative Writing at Maastricht University, where she was taught by Caoilinn Hughes (whose voice she still hears in her head every time she writes a clunky sentence). She successfully completed the MA Literature Today. After that, she spent a year in the United Kingdom to study Creative Writing at Bath Spa University. She's been dreaming of going back to the UK ever since.

Aside from writing fiction, she also writes other genres. For her day job, she writes informative pieces on internet security and online privacy. In her spare time, she also dabbles in poetry and spoken word pieces. One of her proudest moments was when a poem of hers was printed on a café wall as part of a student exhibition.

She's currently working on different novel-length projects. The short story “The Legend of Emma Sondheim”, as published in Luna Station Quarterly, takes place in the same dark world as WHEN THE DARK DANCES, the manuscript she’s currently polishing.
