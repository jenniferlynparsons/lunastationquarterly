short_bio: Christine Boulos teaches Victorian literature at a big university in Toronto.
  The Victorian novel was her second literary love; portal fantasies were her first.
  Somehow, probably when she passed through the magic emigration portal that is the
  Peace Bridge, the two got mixed up, and this story is the result.

Christine Boulos teaches Victorian literature at a big university in Toronto. The Victorian novel was her second literary love; portal fantasies were her first. Somehow, probably when she passed through the magic emigration portal that is the Peace Bridge, the two got mixed up, and she has been writing her way through a strangely altered Victorian Canada ever since.
