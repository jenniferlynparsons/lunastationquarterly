Karen L. Kobylarz was raised on a steady diet of fantasy novels and sword-and-sandal flicks. This led to a life-long love of legends, myth, and history. She is the author of over a dozen short stories, including the award-winning “As Day Follows Night” in Eldritch Science, the Fountain Award-nominated “Cleopatra’s Needle” in Paradox, and “Dragon and Child” in the current issue of Leading Edge. When she’s not reading or writing, Ms. Kobylarz can be found teaching junior high or exploring the halls of local history museums. She has an M.A. in Writing from DePaul University. “Talisman and Bone” is dedicated to the memory of her parents, Fred and Joyce Kobylarz, who turned her into an avid reader and a classic movie buff.
