Karen has always loved watching and reading science-fiction and fantasy, though it wasn’t till she moved from London to the south coast in 2005 that she was able to devote more time to writing.
In 2009, she was runner-up in the Chichester Observer Christmas story competition with a sci-fi tale called ‘Prize Turkeys’. A flash-fiction story, ‘Payback Time’, was published in e-book format by Fiction Brigade in 2012; while a longer story, ‘Chasing the Shadow’, appeared in the science fiction anthology RealLies (Zharmae publishing, 2013).

As a winner in a recent science-fiction competition, Karen will have thee stories published by Audio Arcadia; and she has also enjoyed some success with supernatural stories, three of which will be appearing in anthologies by Horrified Press.
She is currently working on her first speculative fiction novel.
