short_bio: When Richaundra Thursday (she/they) is not daydreaming about temporarily
  spell-stealing the voices of her 8th grade classes so they will listen to directions,
  she is voraciously consuming books on history, philosophy, science fiction and fantasy,
  poetry and science, like an especially pretentious Kirby. She also enjoys such self-esteem
  shattering activities as cooking, playing video games, going to museums and spending
  too much time on Twitter. Her scribbles can be found in The Poet's Haven, Star*Line,
  Blossomry, Eye To The Telescope, First Line and Silver Blade.
