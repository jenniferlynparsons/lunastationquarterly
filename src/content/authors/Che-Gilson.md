Che Gilson is the author of several graphic novels including “Avigon: Gods and Demons” from Image Comics, and “Dark Moon Diary” from Tokyopop. Her urban fantasy novella Carmine Rojas: Dog Fight is forthcoming from Black Opal Books.
She draws copious amounts of Pokémon fan art which can be found with her original work at http://spiderliing666.deviantart.com
She is working on more novels and novellas, including a follow-up to Carmine Rojas: Dog Fight and a Middle Grade novel which is soon to be sent on queries.

Unlike most authors, she is a 'bird person' and has one small yellow lovebird named Igor which she serves to the best of her ability.
Her hobbies include reading, drawing, painting, and collecting Asian Ball Jointed Dolls which went from hobby to passion long ago. She can most frequently be found on the doll forum Den of Angels.
