short_bio: I strive to be a modern day superhero. By day I work as a chemical engineer
  building websites that encourage the use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles.
  Thursdays are the exception, when I map transportation systems as a Geographic Information
  Science graduate student. By night, I write speculative stories and knit. (If I
  can’t save the world, I hope to at least make it more interesting and fuzzy.) Always,
  I am a mom of wonderful Erica, wife to pragmatic Nate, and caretaker of our four
  cats and six chickens, too numerous to name.

As a lifelong dental phobic, I hope you enjoy my first published fiction work, Grork Dentist.  My heart goes out to LSQ for giving this story a home.  My first creative essay was published in April 2019 and will be featured in the Love, You anthology in Fall of 2019.  Random musings can be found on my website Afthead.
