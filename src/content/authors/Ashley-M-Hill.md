short_bio: Ashley spends a lot of her time wondering what more we could do with technology
  and computers. When she isn't writing sci-fi, she's either parenting, socializing,
  tweeting, or otherwise being awesome.

- Her Data Like Fingerprints
---

After nearly two decades on the move as a military child, Ashley M. Hill is a Kansas transplant. By day, she works at the local university and takes care of a really smart child. By evening, she writes, plots, or tries to learn even more about how to make her computers better. (By night, she's asleep in bed watching Netflix.)
She found her voice in science fiction when her curiosity about technology coupled with the urge to tell stories. Her interest in social and feminist issues informs and shapes how she approaches the genre.

She'll read just about anything.
