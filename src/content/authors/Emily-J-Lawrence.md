short_bio: Emily J.‭ ‬Lawrence tells us:‭ ‬I am a young college graduate,‭ ‬eating
  tears and rejection letters as I wait for a‭ "‬real job.‭" ‬Between giving cats
  weird names and holding my fiance,‭ ‬I spend my time creating sentences nobody has
  ever muttered,‭ ‬metaphors never thought of,‭ ‬and characters who take over.‭ ‬My
  work will appear in Relief Magazine and Lit Magazine Fall/Winter‭ ‬2010.
