Rosamund Lannin reads and writes in Chicago, but sends her writing all over. She has published Pushcart Prize-nominated short stories and personal essays in Bluestem Magazine, Strange Horizons, Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet, and Vice. When she's not querying a novel about live action roleplaying (LARP) and the nature of fantasy, you can find her exploring the gloriously weird northwest side.
