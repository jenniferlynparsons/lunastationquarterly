Mac Bowers recently returned to Pennsylvania after spending a year planting roots in Scotland as she earned her Masters in Creative Writing. When she isn't experiencing frequent bouts of existential crisis, she enjoys writing weird stories, playing rugby, and sipping on far too many cups of coffee. Other works of hers can be found in F(r)iction, The Lindenwood Review, and Door Is A Jar, among others.
