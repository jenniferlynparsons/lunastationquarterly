short_bio: I am pleased to be a contributing author at Luna Station Quarterly. This
  magazine is a great venue for women like me, who have always wanted to write but
  did not know of a place where they could easily present their work. The short story
  fiction format is a challenge for me, but the stories are in my head, clamoring
  to get out, so I am rising to that challenge.
stories:
- The Prophet and the Pink Fairy
- The Dream
