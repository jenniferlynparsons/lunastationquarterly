Patricia Correll believes that all humans are natural storytellers. She’s been telling tales since she could string words together, but in the last thirty years or so has graduated from My Little Pony stories to the unholy trinity of fantasy, SF, and horror.
She lives with her husband, their sons, and two elderly cats. When she’s not writing, she spends her time being a stay-at-home mom and occasionally working at a bookstore.
She has been published by Dreamspinner Press, Darwin's Evolutions, Astounding Outpost, Literary e-clectic and The Lovecraft Ezine.
