- 'Issue 048 Author Interview: Andrea Goyan and "A Feather''s Weight"'
short_bio: 'Through storytelling, Andrea Goyan spices up her normal, everyday life
  by exploring the heroes and misfits who lurk within her mind. She credits her years
  as an actress for teaching her how to find humanity in even the most despicable
  villains, and she believes that many of our fears are driven by simple misunderstandings.
  Some of her stories are written to challenge her own beliefs, and if any of her
  characters change her own or one of her reader’s preconceived perceptions, it’s
  a good day. In the past two years, her stories have appeared in The Dark Sire, Sirens
  Call Publications, 101 Words, On Loss: An Anthology, Dirty Girls Magazine, Newfound
  Journal, Halloween Party 2019, and What Sort of Fuckery is This?'
