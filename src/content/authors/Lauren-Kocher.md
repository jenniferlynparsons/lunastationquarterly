Lauren is currently pursuing her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing at Columbia College Chicago, and has received her BA in Creative Writing and English Literature from Miami University (in Ohio, not Florida, unfortunately). In her writing, Lauren enjoys writing speculative fiction about young people and exploring the fantastic and absurd. While she's drawn toward the novel she can't seem to shake the short story bug when it bites. When she's not writing, Lauren spends her time reading, running, cooking, netflixing, crocheting, and generally geeking out. She also spends much of her time working on a volunteer staff for the Young Writers Society, an online forum for young writers to create, share, and discuss all things writing.
