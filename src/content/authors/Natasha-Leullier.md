short_bio: A trained archaeologist, Natasha recently gave in to her long-standing
  desire to write fiction. Bridging the gap between art and science turned out to
  be not so difficult, since her travels and field experiences often provide a unique
  source of inspiration. Unseen places, forgotten histories, and the dark recesses
  of humanity populate many of her stories. She has short fiction published in The
  Watermark and Beat to a Pulp. While she tends towards fantasy with a dark, literary
  flair, she does not feel constrained by or beholden to any genre. French-Canadian
  born, she now lives in the Boston area and edits professionally.
