short_bio: Alexa Wilson Kelly is a writer from New Jersey. She lives in Sydney, Australia,
  where she spends most of her time with a notebook and an entire sleeve of Tim Tams,
  lurking around the Opera House waiting for inspiration.

Alexa Wilson Kelly was once told by a close friend that "your future child's first words are probably going to be 'Dana Scully.'" She still considers this to be both the highest compliment she's ever received and the best indication of her as a person. A native of New Jersey, Alexa now lives in Sydney, and has spent the past two years tromping all over Australia, collecting library cards and writing about every beautiful thing she sees. You can read about her Outback adventures and a lot more on her travel blog, http://youalwaysgobig.wordpress.com.
