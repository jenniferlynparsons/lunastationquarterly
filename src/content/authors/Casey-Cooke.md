Casey Cooke writes speculative fiction and horror, and her work has been published in a variety of literary magazines including the Little Patuxent Review, Dime Show Review, and 365tomorrows. She received her MFA in Creative Writing in 2006, and she’s been teaching Composition to college students for the last six years. When she’s not working or writing, she’s most likely hanging out with her husband and their bulldog, Ludo. She’s also a collector of old books and odd objects; however, due to a complete lack of impulse control, she’s no longer allowed to visit used bookstores or flea markets unattended.
