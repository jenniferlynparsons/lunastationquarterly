Phoenix Mendoza lives in the woods with her wife where she raises pigeons, buries roadkill, and writes. An unashamed enthusiast of the carnal, compostable, and corporeal, she is wholly dedicated to finding and luxuriating in the junction where beauty and disgust meet to rot together. She has published three books: two short horror collections,  Salivation and Yellow Wallpapering, and her debut novel, Thorngale. You can also find her work in a number of literary magazines and anthologies, including but not limited to Wicked Shadow Press's Anthology of the Undead, OFIC Magazine, Flash Fiction Online, and Last Girl's Club. In addition to writing Phoenix also teaches an eight month online course designed for hobby writers seeking to rediscover the joy in their craft. You can learn more about her work and this course from her website: https://phoenixvmendoza.squarespace.com
