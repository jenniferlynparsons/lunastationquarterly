M.J. Klimmek wanted to be a marine biologist when she grew up, but somehow ended up with a PhD in art history. She has been writing stories ever since she could hold a pen but only recently began exploring publishing opportunities.
She lives in northern Germany and works in online marketing. Writing in both English and German, she has tried her hand at fantasy, sci-fi, and steampunk, often focusing on the complex relationship between humans and nature. Her work has appeared in Queer*Welten, an award-winning queer-feminist SFF magazine in her native language. When not writing, she enjoys heavy metal, video games, traveling and weird 19th-century art. She is currently working on her first novel.
