Grumpy software/game developer by day. Scribbling daydreamer by night. Sleep deprived parent full-time. Devon Widmer recently graduated with a PhD in physical chemistry, a degree which she plans to put to use writing a plethora of (dubiously scientific) speculative fiction. Her talents include drinking copious amounts of coffee, forgetting where she set her glasses, and laughing at her own jokes.

Devon's short fiction has appeared in a variety of journals and anthologies, and her story "The Fleshsmith and the Metalsmith" recently won First Place in Queer Sci Fi's 2020 Flash Fiction Contest.

Also, although she often describes herself as grumpy, Devon promises she's actually quite nice! Come say "hi" to her on social media!
