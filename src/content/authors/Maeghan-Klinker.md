- 'Issue 046 Author Interview: Maeghan Klinker and "Mother Haskell"'
short_bio: 'Maeghan is a postgraduate student studying Medieval English at the University
  of St Andrews where she spends her time reading old books and brushing the dust
  off of stories. When she’s not stumbling over medieval texts, she spends her time
  reading sci-fi and fantasy books in Modern English, writing stories, talking to
  the trees, and going on walks with her dog. Confronted with infinite knowledge and
  only one question that can be answered, she would like to know: if the universe
  is expanding, what is it expanding into?'
