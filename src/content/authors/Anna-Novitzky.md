As a scientific subeditor, Anna spends her days making sure that words mean what they're supposed to mean. By night, she lets them run free. She lives in Manchester, UK, and enjoys knitting, learning things, taking pictures of umbrellas and watching films, which she reviews at The Female Gaze: https://thefemalegazemagazine.wordpress.com/. She has also been published in Nature Futures: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v547/n7661/full/547132a.html
