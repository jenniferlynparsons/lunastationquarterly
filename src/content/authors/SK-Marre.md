SK Marre is a Connecticut based author and photographer. When she isn’t writing magazine articles about the best shutter speeds to capture a sunset, she’s probably mountain biking, being bossed around by the cat (the dog has better manners), or working on her fiction. SK has short stories and flash fiction in Havok Publishing (previously Havok Magazine), Unfortunately, Literary Magazine, and History Through Fiction.
