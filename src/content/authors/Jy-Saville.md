short_bio: JY Saville lives in the north of England and writes very short and quite
  long things as the mood takes her. Sometimes they become comics. She blogs at http://thousandmonkeys.wordpress.com/
  where all her free-to-access work can be found alongside weekly ramblings of a (usually)
  literary nature. Some of her stories have appeared at Kzine, Bards and Sages Quarterly,
  and Silver Blade, among others.
