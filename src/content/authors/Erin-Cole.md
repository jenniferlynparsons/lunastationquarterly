Erin Cole grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where dusty combines, water skipper-filled rivers, and shadowed forests were her playgrounds. She has worked an eclectic range of jobs, spanning salsa making, to international warehousing, and helpline counseling for the Alzheimer's Association.

After obtaining her B.S. in psychology, Erin naturally progressed into penning mystery and horror. In 2009, her short story, "Unspoken Bonds", made the Preliminary List for the Tom Howard / John H. Reid Short Story Contest, her non-fiction essay, "My Compass", received honorable mention in the Willamette Writers Kay Snow Writing Contest, and "The Wall of Never Doubt," won 10th place in the Writer's Digest 80th Annual Writing Competition. Still, she is most proud to have readers who enjoy her work.
She has been published in various anthologies and online print magazines and is currently working on her third novel. Hopefully her second novel, the second sequel in the Kate Waters Mysteries, Wicked Tempest, will be released before hell freezes over. She resides in Portland, Oregon with her husband, three children, and one terribly, cute dog, Cosmo.
