short_bio: Tisdale Flannery has a house full of clutter and pet fur, couldn't sink
  a basketball if the net were a super-massive black hole, and fell asleep within
  the first five minutes of every single Microeconomics class in college. She is otherwise
  a good listener, a helpful quality for mothering (21 years), reading Tarot (27 years),
  and writing epic fantasy (38 years). For Tea with Strangers, she will be interviewing
  the characters who populate her favorite deck, Erik C. Dunne's Tarot Illuminati
  (with brilliant commentary by the wise Kim Huggens). Specifically, she will be trying
  to extract advice from the cards for writers of speculative fiction. One of the
  beauties of Tarot is that the message of each card varies according to the deck,
  the reader, the querent, and the circumstances. If you are familiar with the cards
  of the Tarot, you may read this and think, "Hmm. That's not what that card means."
  You would be right. And so would I.
