short_bio: Chikodili Emelumadu likes witchery and weirdness, creatures and aliens.
  She spends her days seeking portals to 'the other side' then gets very depressed
  and eats chocolate when she fails. It's an exhausting cycle. Her stories can be
  found at Eclectica and Running Out of Ink magazines, and her blog Igbophilia.wordpress.com
  where she rants with restraint seeing as her (conservative African) parents now
  know the way to the internet.
stories:
- Bossy Boots
- Tunbi

Chikodili Emelumadu likes witchery and weirdness, creatures and aliens. She spends her days seeking portals to 'the other side' then gets very depressed and eats chocolate when she fails. It's an exhausting cycle.  When Chikodili isn't writing, sheâ€™s reading or cooking or dreaming or being dogsbody to an opinionated three-year-old who likes to do pretend magic and has taken to screaming very, very loudly for no reason that she can see.  Her stories can be found at Eclectica and Running Out of Ink magazines, and her blog Igbophilia.wordpress.com where she rants with restraint seeing as her (conservative African) parents now know the way to the internet.
