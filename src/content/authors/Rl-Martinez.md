R. L. writes mutant stories – the kind that are a little of this and a little of that – that have dark edges and corners.
Her favorite scenes to write are about death and destruction – gotta let the inner killer blow off steam SOMEHOW – followed by scenes with lots of witty banter. Comedy and death make her inner killer very happy.

R. L. has one other story published with Luna Station Quarterly called "The Sacrifice". She also has two full-length fantasy novels out through Lakewater Press. Both are available through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
