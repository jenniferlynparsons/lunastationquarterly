Megan Lee Beals lives in Tacoma, Washington where it rains often, yet the city remains accessible even to those without a boat. Her fiction has been featured online at Literary Orphans and Mulberry Fork Review, and anthologized in Stamps Vamps & Tramps and The Future Embodied. When not writing or knitting or collecting more hobbies, Megan works in a bookstore where she enjoys an ongoing and unconventional education in nearly everything fit to print.
