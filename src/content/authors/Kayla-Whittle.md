Born and raised in New Jersey, Kayla Whittle currently works in marketing at a medical publisher. She studied English and Creative Writing at The College of New Jersey. She prefers to write fantasy and loves to incorporate the feel of a fairy tale with a little twist of unease. Her first published story appears in Luna Station Quarterly.

When she isnâ€™t writing, she can often be found spouting Disney trivia, attempting to learn how to embroider, and critiquing literature via Instagram stories @caughtbetweenthepages.
