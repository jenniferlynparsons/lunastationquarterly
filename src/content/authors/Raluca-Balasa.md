Raluca Balasa holds an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Nevada, Reno. Her approach to writing is character-oriented, often dealing with love-hate relationships, antiheroes, and antagonists who make you agree with them. Her short work has appeared in Andromeda Spaceways, Aurealis, Psychopomp, and Grimdark Magazine, among others. When she's not writing, she can be found playing the piano or spilling things.

Currently, Raluca works as a freelance editor and English teacher in the Toronto area. Her debut science fiction novel, Blood State, is coming out from Renaissance Press in 2020.
