short_bio: Aspen deLainey was born with a silver pen clutched firmly in her chubby
  fingers.‭ ‬She wrote her first story at three,‭ ‬with crayon,‭ ‬in a picture book.‭
  ‬Even her first critical review,‭ ‬in the form of a spanking,‭ ‬did not deter her
  as she continued to translate her visits with the Muse into stories.‭ ‬2010‭ ‬has
  seen her works start to gain acceptance in the publishing world.
