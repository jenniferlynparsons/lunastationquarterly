Cindy Phan (she/her) writes about the everyday fantastic, in which the boundaries between the tragic and the absurd shift, transform and misbehave. Nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, her fiction has appeared in Augur Magazine, The/tƐmz/Review, khōréō magazine and others. She and her partner live in a wonderfully cluttered home with their son and poodle. She has six tarantulas. She prefers Garamond.
