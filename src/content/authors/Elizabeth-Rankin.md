Elizabeth Rankin is the daughter of a librarian and grew up in the stacks, creating stories of her own. After starting her career in publishing, she shifted to marketing, working primarily with scientific manufacturing companies - not a bad place to be when searching for ideas for her next piece of speculative fiction. When she's not crafting stories or reading them, you'll find Elizabeth experimenting in the kitchen, taking on too many volunteer projects, or deep in research on medieval history. She currently resides in Cleveland, OH, with her two rescue French bulldogs.
