Suz Thackston is a weird old introvert who loves nothing better than to hole up on her small farm, surround herself with books and cups of tea, and snuggle in. Fortunately there are spoiled cats, a fat dog and an old pony who require attention, as well as mundane things like work and errands.

After homeschooling her own kids Suz continued to feed her addiction to teens and tweens by teaching Greek mythology, Shakespeare and ancient world Literature enrichment classes at FCC for many years. These days she spends her free time digging into the minutiae of the ancient Greek world, wistfully looking for horses upon whom to amble about, gardening very badly, and of course, writing. Fantasy, fairy tales, re-writings of obscure old myths and YA are the favorite genres.
