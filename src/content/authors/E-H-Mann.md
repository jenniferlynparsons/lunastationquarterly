  long.

E. H. Mann is an emerging author based in Melbourne, Australia (she/they pronouns to taste). They write fantasy and science-fiction, with a preference for short fiction and a dedication to queer and other minority representation. Their stories have appeared or will appear in Mother of Invention (Twelfth Planet Press, 2018) and the 2018 Remastered Words audio anthology, Fabled Journey.
In her day job, she’s a mild-mannered customer servant agent – a role whose main advantage is leaving more time for writing, blogging, organising speculative fiction conventions, knitting, costume-making, and reading other people’s writing and having opinions about it (slush reader for Aurealis magazine).

They are asexual, which seems perfectly normal to them, but since they’ve noticed other people sometimes find it confusing they like to take opportunities to write and talk about asexuality. Their favourite asexual fictional character is Erin from Girls With Slingshots. Their gender identity is a work in progress.

Unlike every other writer in existence, she does not own a cat. But it’s only a matter of time.
