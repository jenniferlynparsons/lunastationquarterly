An Atlantic Canadian, Kellee has spent a life time writing. According to her late grandfather she was born with a pen in one hand and paper in the other. However, she was married with three kids before she began to take her talent seriously. To fine tune it, she first took a course with the Institute of Children's Literature. Her first publication after finishing the course was "Ravens in the Family" (a true experience piece), published with an Atlantic Canadian magazine, Rural Delivery. Since then she has had many stories, poems and articles published, both children's and adult's. In addition to being the Youth Imagination fiction editor, she occasionally guest blogs for Silver Pen, and is on the Silver Pen Board of Directors.
