Erin K. Wagner (also E. K. Wagner) is a professor by trade, a medievalist by discipline, and a writer of speculative fiction by design.

She lives in upstate New York, a storied and story-making place, but her roots are in Appalachia. She grew up in the hills and hollers of rural southeast Ohio, just across the river from West Virginia. As a professor of English, she teaches literature, writing, and communication. Her interests, both academic and creative, lie in examining how the human responds to the nonhuman in whatever form it appearsâ€“artificial, supernatural, or unidentified.

Her creative writing has appeared in award-winning magazines like Clarkesworld, Nightmare, and Apex. Her books are available through DAW, Aqueduct Press and Tor.com. She is an active member of SFWA. You can find her online at www.erinkwagner.com.
