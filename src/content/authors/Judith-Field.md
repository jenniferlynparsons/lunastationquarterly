Judith Field lives in London. She’s a pharmacist, medical indexer and editor.  The daughter of writers, she learned how to agonise over fiction submissions at her mother’s (and father’s) knee. In 2009, she made a New Year resolution to start writing and get published within the year. Pretty soon she realised how unrealistic that was but, in fact, it worked because she got a slot to write a weekly column in a local paper shortly before the end of the year. It ran for a several years and she still writes occasional feature articles for the paper. Her non-fiction articles have appeared in genealogy and general interest magazines.
Her fiction, mainly speculative, has appeared in a variety of publications in the USA, UK and Australia. When not writing she works at the day job, studies for a Masters in English, sings and swims. She was Science Fiction Editor at Red Sun Magazine and is an Assistant Editor at Gathering Storm Magazine.
