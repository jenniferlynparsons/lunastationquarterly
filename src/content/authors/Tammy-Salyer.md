short_bio: Tammy is an independently published speculative fiction writer and freelance
  editor. Her fangirl goal in life is to sing karaoke with Commander Mark Hadfield
  and novelist Neil Gaiman aboard the International Space Station. But sheâ€™d settle
  for digestifs and tea with them somewhere on Earth, too. She'd love to hear from
  you! Stop by and say hi at her website (www.tammysalyer.com) or join her newsletter

Tammy is an inveterate verbarian who spends her day surrounded by the written word, both hers and others'. As an ex-paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division, her stories are often as gritty as a grunt's pile of three-week-old field gear. Her military science fiction novel Contract of Defiance is the first book in the Spectras Arise trilogy and debuted to acclaim in Spring 2012. Contract of Betrayal is the second in the trilogy, and the final book, Contract of War, completes it. When not hunched like a Morlock over her writing desk, Tammy runs and bikes silly miles in the playground of Southern California and spends an inappropriate amount of time watching Henry Rollins videos on YouTube.

She hopes you enjoy reading her works and welcomes your reviews.
