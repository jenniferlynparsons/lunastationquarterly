---

After graduating from Tufts University with a degree in Asian Studies and Chinese, Dana Berube lived in Beijing, where she translated medical charts, lawn mower manuals, and complaints about strange things found in yogurt. Her short story “Lost Causes” was chosen as a finalist for the Chicago Tribune’s 2018 Nelson Algren Literary Award. Another short story, "Ganbold and the Best Drone in Mongolia," will be featured in a forthcoming science fiction anthology by Zombies Need Brains, LLC. Dana currently lives in Boston and is working on a fantasy trilogy. When not writing she can be found drawing, petting dogs, and trying to learn every language in the world. 干杯！
