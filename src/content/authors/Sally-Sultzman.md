Sally Sultzman was a reader first, a writer second, but always a storyteller. A member of SFWA, she talks writing with anyone who stands still long enough to listen. Her short story “The Book That Wasn't” was published by Cast of Wonders as part of their 2022 Banned Books week (Ep 508). “Welcome to Your New Home” was featured in Tales of Sley House 2023. “A Murder of Crows” was in To Appalachia With Love in 2024, which she also edited as Sarah STETS, and “An Exciting Career Opportunity!” was in Die Laughing in April, 2025.  She lives in rural Illinois with her family, her rescue dog, and a collection of oversized tea mugs. Find out more about Sally’s stories at www.sallysultzman.com.
