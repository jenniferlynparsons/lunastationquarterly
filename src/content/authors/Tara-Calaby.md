short_bio: Tara Calaby lives in Melbourne, Australia with her wife and far too many
  books. Her writing has appeared in publications such as Grimdark Magazine, Daily
  Science Fiction, Aurealis and Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine, and she is
  an Assistant Editor for Luna Station Quarterly. She is currently a PhD candidate
  in English, which involves a lot of sneezing while she digs through dusty archives
  for her research into female patients in Victorian asylums. In her free time, she
  can be found playing video games or attempting to learn Welsh.
