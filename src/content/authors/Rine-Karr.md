- 'Issue 049 Author Interview: Rine Karr and "Rhyme and Reason"'
short_bio: Rine Karr (rin-ē kär) (she/they) is a daydreamer, writing science fiction
  and fantasy by moonlight, and a cog in the machine, editing and coding by daylight.
  In what feels like another lifetime, Rine studied anthropology, archaeology, and
  religious studies, international human rights and political economy, and Buddhist
  studies and art history at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as worked
  in museums. Now, Rine relishes in the free time that being away from academia affords
  and enjoys devouring books, drinking tea, and meditating on the universe. Rine grew
  up under the mist of three enormous waterfalls on the traditional land of the Haudenosaunee
  and Wenrohronon and has lived in Hong Kong and London. Rine is currently and almost
  always in the midst of writing a novel.
