short_bio: Irene Grazzini, a young native of Arezzo, Italy, is a radiologist by day
  in a Tuscan hospital. When not practicing medicine, she finds herself inventing
  both possible and impossible universes, past, present, and future. Two recently
  published novels of hers, (called Dominant and Recessive, published by Fanucci,
  Rome) have been acclaimed by lovers of speculative fiction. The Smile is her first
  publication in English. She hopes that further forays into the North American world
  of science fiction and fantasy become a regular part of her personal future.

Irene Grazzini has long been a voracious reader as well as prolific writer of speculative fiction. Despite her youth, she has already attracted considerable attention from other similarly-inclined readers in her Italian homeland. She has published short stories in various Italian magazines and has also won several prizes. She continues as well to write reviews, edit stories, and comment on video-games for the Italian online Fantasy Magazine. A futuristic novel  trilogy of hers is now in  bookstores throughout Italy. Her collaboration with Joyce Myerson, a literary translator, has led to the completion of an alternate history novel in English (called Iris: Messages from the Third Reich) and hopefully  it will appear sometime soon across North America. Irene continues to live in her hometown of Arezzo. She completed her medical degree and specialization two years ago and now works as a radiologist in a Tuscan hospital. As part of her residency, she spent six months working at the Montreal Neurological Hospital in Canada. She is also well-published in her medical field.  A website is English is forthcoming.
