short_bio: Eliza Sinclair is yet another author who finds it awkward to write about
  herself in the third person. With the help of tea, a patient spouse and characters
  who like to bombard her with their life stories, Eliza settles in after her day
  job to write tales of adventure in far away worlds. When she’s not busy untangling
  plot-knots you can find her haunting local bookstores and libraries, gaming with
  her friends, buried in art projects, or wrangling cats.
