JM Cyrus writes whenever there is a chance, and reads even when there isn’t one. With a master’s degree in Reception Theory, and a thesis on the reader's imagination, she feels academically validated to essentially play make-believe in her head.

Her work can be found in over a dozen anthologies, magazines and online venues, such as Improbable Press, Speculation Publications, Utopia Science Fiction, All Worlds Wayfarer, Orion's Beau, Star*Line and AntipodeanSF.
