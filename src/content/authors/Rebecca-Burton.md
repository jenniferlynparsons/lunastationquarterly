Rebecca Burton is a queer, neurodivergent writer who disappears into the fantasy worlds in her head to distract herself from her day job helping people complete their tax returns. When not writing, she can be found learning (too many) languages, drinking (too much) tea, and muttering about hair dye and k-drama on Twitter (@TyGrammarRex). You can check out her other published work on her website: rebeccaburton.me ​
