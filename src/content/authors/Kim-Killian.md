short_bio: Kim Killian works in the world of Information Technology where all things
  remain black and white; to offset this crazy perspective she writes. I met Emily
  after I had a car accident involving a dump truck. She had asked if she could touch
  my arm, as I nodded, she reached into her skirt pocket and pulled out a long, thin,
  red ribbon. She tied the ribbon around my left wrist and mumbled a prayer. I never
  saw Emily again and often wondered why.
