short_bio: Sarah McGill has published fantasy short stories in Giganotosarus, Luna
  Station Quarterly, Metaphorosis, and elsewhere. Her favorite time and place is post-revolution
  France at the height of the Death Cabarets, mostly because the bohemians really
  did walk their lobsters in the rose gardens and pretend hydropathes were Canadian
  animals whose feet were made into drinking glasses.
stories:
- Down among the Fireweed
- Bone to Bleeding Bone
