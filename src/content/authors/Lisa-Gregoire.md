- To the Pole!™
---

Lisa Gregoire is a recovering journalist turned fiction writer. After working her way through various Canadian newspapers and magazines and earning a pair of National Magazine Awards, she stepped away from journalism and started making up stories instead, naively thinking the transition would be both smooth and easy. It was neither. Humbled, she presses on, writing daily from her home in Ottawa with her writer/editor husband and twin teen daughters.

Find her work in The Walrus, Canadian Geographic, Eighteen Bridges, Nunatsiaq News, Qwerty, filling Station and Agnes & True.
