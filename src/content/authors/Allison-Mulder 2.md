Allison Mulder writes fantasy, science fiction, and horror. She grew up in the Midwest, and enjoys cheesy jokes and eldritch horrors in equal measure. Any list of hobbies will inevitably be out of date by the time this bio appears, but some interests in the ever-shifting rotation include: Dnd, drawing, cooking, crochet, anime, videogames, and the creepiest creatures that the cold, black depths of the ocean have to offer. Her stories have appeared in Fireside Fiction, Escape Pod, Cast of Wonders, and more. You can find them at allisonmulder.wordpress.com, though Allison herself is more easily found on Twitter as @AMulderWrites.
