I write contemporary and epic fantasy primarily and sometimes, when the mood strikes, wander off into science fiction. My work has been published at Abyss & Apex, Apparition Lit, A-Minor Magazine, Electric Spec, and Red Weather.

Describing how my writing fits within the broad, delicious scope that is SFF feels like trying to nail jelly to a tree, but I’ll give it my level best try. At the moment, I write SFF stories that primarily revolve around characters who identify as women. I like writing about women and girls who struggle with how the world sees and wants them to be vs. how they see themselves and want to move in the world. I'm also drawn to writing about the complex relationships between women of different generations, backgrounds, and class distinctions. If that sort of thing interests you, I recommend reading my story Tiny Lights or another story Tree on Fire.

I do occasionally break out from dark, sad stories where misunderstood women battle for a better place in the social pecking order or just flat out reject the social order altogether. A youth spent watching 80s and 90s Australian comedies and reading Shel Silverstein poetry left me with a big love of the absurd. If you enjoy science fiction on the silly side, check out I Want You to Want Me and Urgent: Lost Bekip.

Ok, random fact time.
– I’m a PADI-certified scuba diver. I love crossword puzzles (surprise, surprise).
– I was a professional actor for 10+ years – an experience in near-constant rejection that has prepared me quite nicely for the near-constant rejection I now receive as an emerging SFF writer.
– I’m also a big-time introvert (this personality trait is probably why I’m no longer an actor, but that’s another story for another time) If you see me at a party, I’m the guest most likely to be perusing the host’s novel, magazine, comic book, record, stamp, carnivorous plant and/or [fill in the blank] collection or petting their household dog or cat or engaging with another introvert who is totally into having intense, one-on-one conversations about Shel Silverstein or 80s and 90s Australian comedies or super-dark dystopian novels.
– I’m a proud, progressive-leaning feminist.

I believe in the power of walking outside in a safe space. It’s amazing the disagreements you can hash out, jumbled thoughts you can untangle, feelings of depression that can be softened, buried emotions you can give voice to just by taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood or a local park with someone who loves you.

I believe we all have stories to tell. And, now more than ever, we have to learn to be better listeners.
