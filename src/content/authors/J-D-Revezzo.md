Juli D. Revezzo has long been in love with writing, a love built by devouring everything from the Arthurian legends, to the works of Michael Moorcock, and the classics and has a soft spot for classic the "Goths" of the 19th century. Her short fiction has been published in Crossing the River: An Anthology of Sacred Journeys, Dark Things II: Cat Crimes, The Scribing Ibis, Eternal Haunted Summer, Twisted Dreams Magazine and Luna Station Quarterly and Crossed Genres' "Posted stories for Haiti relief" project, while her non-fiction has been included in The Scarlet Letter. She has also, on occasion, edited the popular e-zine Nolan's Pop Culture Review... But her heart lies in the storytelling. She is the author of The Antique Magic series and the Paranormal Romance Harshad Wars series and is a member of the Magic Appreciation Tour and Indie Author Network.
