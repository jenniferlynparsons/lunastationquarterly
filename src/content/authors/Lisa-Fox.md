Lisa Fox is a pharmaceutical market researcher by day and fiction writer by night. She enjoys crafting short stories and short screenplays across genres, but most of her work can best be described as literary speculative fiction. She thrives on the thrill of creating something out of nothing, in transforming life’s ‘what ifs’ to prose that flashes a mirror on the human condition. As a writer, nothing makes her happier than having readers say that her work made them feel something or look at the world in a different way.

Lisa won the 2018 NYC Midnight Short Screenplay competition and in 2020 had work nominated for a Pushcart Prize and Best Small Fictions. Her stories are featured in various online publications, including Metaphorosis, New Myths, Brilliant Flash Fiction, previously in Luna Station Quarterly, and in several anthologies.

A resident of northern New Jersey in the USA, Lisa thrives in the chaos of suburbia. She and her husband are kept busy by the comings and goings of their two sons and by the demands of their new double-doodle puppy.
