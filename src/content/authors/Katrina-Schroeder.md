short_bio: I'm a copy, line, and developmental editor and book coach! I work directly
  with authors and publishers to improve and prepare manuscripts for publication.
  I'm a certified editor through ACES/Poytner, am a member of ACES and EfA, and have
  completed the Developmental Editing for Fiction course through the Editorial Arts
  Academy. I'm also currently going through my Book Coach certification with Author
  Accelerator. In my free time I love to read (obviously...) and kayak. If I can do
  both, that's a great day!
