Physically, Allison Mulder resides in the Midwest, writing fantasy, science fiction, and horror. Figuratively, she exists somewhere in the Venn diagram of silly, scary, and sappy. She also has a frankly untenable number of hobbies. Her stories have appeared in Fireside Fiction, Escape Pod, Cast of Wonders, and more. You can find them all squirreled away at allisonmulder.wordpress.com, though Allison herself is more easily found on Bluesky as @amulderwrites.bsky.social.
