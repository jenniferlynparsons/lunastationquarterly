Originally from Rhode Island, Olivia DeSimone is a part-time writer and full-time nomad. An Honors graduate of Brown University, she loves to research any topic, but especially folklore, archaeology, and foreign languages. Her writing explores what it means to live on the road, the experience of being an Autistic woman, and her Sicilian heritage. Her creative fiction and literary analyses have been published online and recognized in several competitions; examples of her work and upcoming projects are available on her website, livdesimone.com. Olivia can be found somewhere in the world, exploring oddities in an overlooked city, or wandering through the woods, alone.
