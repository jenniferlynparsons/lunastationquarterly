Maya Dworsky grew up in Israel where she lived with many cats, and now lives in the US, where there are none. Many author profiles seem to mention cats, so she has decided to do so as well. Maya Dworsky is not particularly accustomed to writing about herself in third person, so she has asked her wife to help.

Maya first came to the US to study Anthropology, and her research revolves around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it is imagined through pedagogical narrative â€” specifically how we teach citizenship and personhood to our children through the stories we tell. Maya is at that point in her doctoral studies where literally the only thing she can talk about is her research, and is therefore a very challenging friend, and spouse.
