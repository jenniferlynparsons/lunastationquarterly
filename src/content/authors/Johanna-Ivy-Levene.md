Johanna Levene is on leave from the world of science and research to pursue her dream of writing a novel worthy of her mother’s reading. (A goal she accomplished in June of 2025. Her mom loved the book. Her new goal is to get the book published.) Johanna used to work as a chemical engineer and a geospatial analyst encouraging the use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles across North America. She enjoys reading and writing speculative stories, knitting, and urban farming. The Levene homestead consists of Johanna, her daughter and muse Erica, her pragmatic husband Nate, four cats, two guinea pigs, and eight chickens.
 

 LSQ published Johanna’s first story, “Grork Dentist,” in June of 2019 and she is delighted that “Bumblecat” has also found a home here in December of 2025. She’s also been published in McSweeney’s Internet Tendencies, the creative anthology, “Love, You,” and several boring technical journals. Her musings can be found at http://afthead.com.
