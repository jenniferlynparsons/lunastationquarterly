Hiya,
Me in five facts or less: - Things I learned: Hons BA in Creative Writing & English Lit from the University of Windsor/Game Design Diploma with Honours from Vancouver Film School
- Things I do: I write. I draw. I make more flowcharts than I care to admit.
- Things I get paid to do: scrounge (not for profit), teach, make snazzy graphics, write, edit, present
- Things I love: Batman, llamas, and sushi
- Han shot first.
