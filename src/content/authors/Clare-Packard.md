Clare Packard has always been away in imaginary lands, whilst inhabiting several real ones. She spent many years living abroad in both Europe and America, before eventually returning home to Melbourne, Australia. She has a degree in History from the University of Edinburgh and enjoys drawing inspiration from historical settings and cultures for her fantasy worlds. She’s working as a librarian, but currently training for a career in museums and archives so that she can look after ‘cool old stuff’. When not writing, Clare can usually be found attempting craft projects, bopping to electro swing, and cheerfully bothering her friends about her latest favourite book. She also runs a blog, The Grimm Librarian, where she reviews retellings of fairytales, folklore, and mythology.
