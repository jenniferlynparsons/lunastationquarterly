Jude-Marie Green is a writer of genre (science fiction & fantasy, plus the occasional horror) fiction.  She lives in Southern California amid palm trees, orange trees, avocado trees, roses, and birds.  Lots of birds.
She is a fan of long standing.  Her first convention was in 1977 at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott.  She attends many conventions, including NorWesCon in Seattle where she is frequently a panelist and professional author as part of the Fairwood Writers Workshop.

A few years ago a friend challenged her to write a short story.  She thought, “I can do that!”  Twenty six revisions later, that story still hasn’t sold, but she is a much better writer.  And has sold many other stories to online and print publications.
