Like a magpie, Rhonda Parrish is constantly distracted by shiny things. Sheâ€™s the editor of many anthologies and author of plenty of books, stories and poems (some of which have even been nominated for awards!). She lives in Edmonton, Alberta, and she can often be found there playing Dungeons and Dragons, bingeing crime dramas, making blankets or cheering on the Oilers.

Her website is at http://www.rhondaparrish.com and her Patreon is at https://www.patreon.com/RhondaParrish.
