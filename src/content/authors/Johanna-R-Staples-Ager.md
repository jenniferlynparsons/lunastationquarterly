short_bio: Johanna Staples-Ager is a student who writes speculative fiction, open-water
  swims, practices primitive survival skills, runs long distances, plays the violin,
  studies biology, and reads too much (and, at the same time, never enough). Her post-apocalyptic
  novel-in-progress, Braving the New World, is based on Shakespeare’s The Tempest
  and takes place on an ecologically devastated Earth and an ark-spaceship run by
  people who have essentially deified Charles Darwin. Her work can be found in the
  Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association’s Fusion magazine.
