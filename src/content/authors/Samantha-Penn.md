short_bio: A scenic artist by day and a writer by night, Samantha has always had a
  creative side and an active imagination. Whether it's painting a theatrical backdrop
  or developing her latest character's backstory, she always has a new project in
  the works. When she's not working on a show, you can find her working on her next
  DnD campaign, rewatching Parks and Recreation, or playing Animal Crossing.
