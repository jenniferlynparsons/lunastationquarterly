short_bio: Victoria is a Brazilian who sometimes reads and sometimes writes, but has
  always been passionate about all kinds of stories. When she's not dealing with her
  never ending to-read pile or adopting new succulents and cacti, she lives her secret
  life as an average young adult trying to figure out how the world works. You may
  find her in one of her hometown's dusty second-hand bookshops or, once in a while,
  on her corner of the internet.
