Jenny Perry Carr is group vice president of scientific services for a medical communications company by day, budding sci-fi/horror writer at night, which sounds much like the beginnings of a superheroâ€™s bio. But alas, her only superpower is remembering random facts, like the human body contains trillions of microorganisms that outnumber our own cells by 10 to 1! She has a PhD in molecular neurobiology from Yale University and unleashes her scientific insights into her spine-chilling sci-fi and horror tales. You can find her captivating stories in the anthologies Dog Save the King, Troubadours and Space Princesses, Rhapsody of the Spheres, Mythical Monsters, and Murderbirds. She can be found on her website, jennyperrycarr.com, or on Facebook @JennyPerryCarr.
