Victoria Sandbrook is a speculative fiction writer, a freelance editor, and an outdoor enthusiast. Her writing to date has focused on the fantastic, from second-world to historical to steampunk. Her short fiction has appeared or is forthcoming in SWORD & SONNET, SHIMMER, and CAST OF WONDERS.

Victoria holds a M.A. in Publishing and Writing from Emerson College and is a graduate of Viable Paradise. She is also a member of the Boston Speculative Fiction Writing Group and the Codex writer's forum.
Her family hails from at least three continents, and her roots reach Peru, Spain, Russia, England, and Ireland. Every branch seems to have at least one storyteller in it, so her life as a writer may be at least partially genetic.

Currently a resident of New England, Victoria spends her summers hiking the White Mountains with Wilderness Heals, a fundraising hike that benefits the Elizabeth Stone House, a local nonprofit addressing homelessness, domestic violence, substance abuse, and trauma.

Victoria and her husband, Mike, and their daughter, ELF, live in the suburbs with their dogs, apple trees, and multitude of streaming devices.
