Diana daylights as a librarian in New York's Capital Region. When not dispensing reference and supervising student employees, she divides her writing time between contemporary romance and weird regional tales. She has a soft spot for f/f, but loves exploring queer friendships, families, and other relationships in her stories. An admitted place obsessive, she's Florida-born and bred, but lived in Cleveland for a time and left part of her heart behind.

Horses, heavy metal, and fantasy paperbacks are some of Diana's favorite things. Her bookshelf collects names like Jo Walton, Victor LaValle, Thomas Hardy, and Jesmyn Ward. Catch her donating to the local coffeehouse's tip jar, or hanging on the saddling paddock fence.
