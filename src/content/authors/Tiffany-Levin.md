short_bio: My Chinese name is Wang Lishan, better known to my friends as Tiffany.
  I am a Singaporean of Chinese Hokkien descent. I write short stories, narrative
  essays and I am also working on a novel. I studied English Literature at University
  of London. As I used to head the Literature department of Page One Singapore before
  its closure, my affection for brick and mortar bookstores was deepened through the
  experience. When not reading or writing, I enjoy taking my terrier for a long walk.
  I enjoy running too. I find both activities gratifying particularly when I hit a
  snag with my writing. My writing could also be found on University of London Official
  Student Blog at http://londoninternational-blog.com/category/english/, and a food
  heritage blog at https://smallbigfeast.com/.
