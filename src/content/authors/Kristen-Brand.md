If Kristen Brand could have any superpower, she'd want telekinesis so she wouldn't have to move from her computer to pour a new cup of tea. She spends far too much time on the internet, and when she's not writing, she's usually reading novels or comic books. She lives in Florida, the Sunshine State, and will someday go outside for long enough to actually get some sun.
Her superhero novels include Hero Status and Villainous, and she runs a weekly online web serial, Fight Crime! (A Love Story), at kristenbrand.com.
