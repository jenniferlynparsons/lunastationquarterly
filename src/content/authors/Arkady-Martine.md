Arkady Martine is a speculative fiction writer and, as Dr. AnnaLinden Weller, is a historian of the Byzantine Empire and an apprentice city planner. Under both names she writes about border politics, rhetoric, propaganda, and the edges of the world.

Arkady grew up in New York City where she was raised by wild classical musicians. She holds a PhD in Byzantine History from Rutgers University in New Jersey, and a Masters in Classical Armenian in from Oxford. After completing her doctorate in 2014, Arkady taught at a small liberal arts college in Canada and then held a research postdoctoral position in Sweden. Currently, while she is at work on a book about her postdoctoral research into narratives of empire on the Byzantine-Armenian frontier, she is pursuing a master’s degree in urban planning, with particular interest in resilient cities and climate change.

Arkady began to write original fiction seriously while in graduate school, though she’d been writing fanfiction since she was a teenager (and continues to participate in fandom to this day). In 2013, she attended the Viable Paradise writer’s workshop. Her short fiction has appeared in Uncanny Magazine, Apex Magazine, Shimmer, and Strange Horizons, amongst other places. Her debut novel, A MEMORY CALLED EMPIRE, appears from Tor in 2019.

Arkady currently lives in Baltimore with her wife, the author Vivian Shaw.
