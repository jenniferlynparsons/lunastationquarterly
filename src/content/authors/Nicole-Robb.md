There are two things in the world that I truly love: Writing and travel.

When I'm not jotting down memoirs of my adventures around the world, I'm often scribbling down fantasy or sci-fi short stories to serve as vehicles to convey my pride, frustration, confusion, or random "what if" thoughts about what's going on in the world around me.

I've recently completed my first novel, "Children of the Midnight Sun", with the hopes of finding a publisher in the near future.
