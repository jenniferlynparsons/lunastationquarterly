Jo Weir is a Dutch writer whose stories happily (and tragically) weave through all speculative genres. She has been published in Andromeda Spaceways. When not writing or frolicking in nature, she works as a project manager helping to make her city a welcoming place for people from around the world. She lives in the Netherlands with her husband and cat, and endeavors to get out of the country as much as possible to more vertically inclined places—preferably with snow on them.
