Jordan Taylor’s lyrical fantasy stories have appeared in magazines including Uncanny, The Deadlands, Fireside, and Beneath Ceaseless Skies. Her story “The Nine Scents of Sorrow” was nominated for the 2021 World Fantasy Award. Her writing is feminist and character-focused, often centered around women’s relationships or complex characters. She currently lives in Seattle, WA, where she shares a cottage near the ocean with her husband, their corgi, and far too many books. You can follow her on her website at jordantaylorwrites.com, or on Twitter @JordanRTaylor13.
