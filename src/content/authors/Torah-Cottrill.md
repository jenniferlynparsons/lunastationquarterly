short_bio: I’m an editor in the Pacific Northwest, where we long for the sun until
  summer and then gripe until it starts to rain again. "The Face Thief" began, as
  most of my stories do, as a dream.

- The Face Thief
---

I’ve lived on four continents and worked as a house cleaner, a diplomat, and an envelope stuffer at the FDIC. Currently, I’m an editor in the Pacific Northwest, where I live in a house full of unruly teenagers and domestic animals suffering from an assortment of behavioral insufficiencies. I’ve had several short stories published so far, and I'm working on my first novel.
