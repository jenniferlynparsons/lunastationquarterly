Laura Stone is a Gothic fiction writer with a BA Honours degree in English and Journalism.  Her more recent pieces can be found in the Anansi Archives, Flash Phantoms and Night Picnic Press.   Her writing tends to lean towards the macabre, but she is actually quite a nice person!   She currently resides in rural Bristol, England â€” an area she finds quite inspirational.
