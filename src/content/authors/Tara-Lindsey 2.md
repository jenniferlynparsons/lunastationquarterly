short_bio: My name is Tara Lindsey. I am a poet, percussionist, photographer, shamanic
  practitioner, shape shifter & Trickster. I am always learning; about the Hermetic
  arts, about theoretical physics, about 19th century European art, & about the stories,
  songs and language of my Irish ancestors. I'll make you laugh. I'll make you think.
  I make no promises.
