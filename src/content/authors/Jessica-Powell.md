Also known to some as "Jehzavere", Â I am a Level 31 Chaotic Neutral Human Bard and Technomancer. My Skills include: Digital Painting, Writing, Web Witchery, Badass Gamemastering, Mad Tea Party Hosting, Alchemy and Astromancy. When not diabolically plotting or pouring over star charts and airship schematics in my library I like to spoil my pets and go on adventures to new places.
