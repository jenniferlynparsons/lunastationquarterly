Susan is a new writer who recently completed the Open University module in Creative Writing. Her stories generally have a supernatural or apocalyptic theme and are inspired by real locations and experiences, which are then blended with folklore, legend, and mythology.
She lives in Scotland and spends as much time as possible exploring the wild and beautiful places on her doorstep. When at home she spends her time writing and listening to podcasts on the paranormal.
