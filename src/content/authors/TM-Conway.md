T.M. Conway lives in a little house on the edge of Northumberland, England, and looks longingly across the sea towards Denmark on her daily beach walks. When she is not teaching English to students in Brazil, China and Russia by the magic of the internet, she writes fiction that encompasses magical realism, fantasy and the uncanny. She recently finished her MA in Creative Writing at Newcastle University, and her work appeared in an anthology published last year by Newcastle University and the Newcastle Centre for the Literary Arts. She is currently writing a fantasy novel.
