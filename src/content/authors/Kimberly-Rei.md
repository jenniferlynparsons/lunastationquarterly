short_bio: When I was five years old, my parents gave me a set of Children's Classics.
  I couldn't yet read them, but I remember being giddy with the potential. That Christmas
  launched my love of words. I've been writing and reading for as long as I can remember.
  I am fortunate to live in gorgeous Florida with my wondrous wife, where beaches
  and crisp sunlight inspire me daily. It is entirely on me that sunlight rarely makes
  it into my stories.
