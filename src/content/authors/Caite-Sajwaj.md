---

Caite Sajwaj (she/her) grew up on a small farm in eastern Kansas, where she spent most of her time trudging through the fields, reading to her father’s cows, and, inevitably, writing her own stories—which she then read to her father’s cows. Caite’s fiction has been published in a number of venues, including Luna Station Quarterly, The Arcanist, and Metaphorosis Magazine. She is currently querying a contemporary fantasy novel while working on her next project. Caite lives in Lawrence, Kansas with her partner and their rescue dog, Josie. When not writing, she enjoys gardening, craft cocktails, and befriending the neighborhood crows. Read more of her work at caitesajwaj.com.
