Avril Mulligan is a primary school music teacher and writer of short fiction from Perth, Western Australia. Her work has appeared in Aurealis, Meniscus, Andromeda Spaceways, Verandah and other fine publications. When she is not teaching or writing you will find her walking somewhere outdoorsy, singing with her choir or curled up with a good book. Mostly, she finds herself writing about wild places, wild hearts and impossible decisions.
