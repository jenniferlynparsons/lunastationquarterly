Amara Mesnik is an award-winning writer and filmmaker with a love for all things science, fiction, and science fiction. Based in NYC, she studied film production at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts with a minor in molecular biology, just for fun. Her thesis film, ‘In Suspension’ (released on the channel DUST in 2022) won several awards, including Best Sci Fi Short Film at the 2021 Next Generation Indie Film Awards and the 2022 Cannes Short Film Festival, and Best Short Script at Other Worlds Austin in 2020. Her first short story, ‘Lost in Intuition’, was published in DreamForge Magazine in 2023, and received an honorable mention from the Sapiens Plurum Awards in 2022. Amara currently works as a video editor at BBC Studios in New York, and spends her free time hammering away at something that’s finally beginning to resemble a debut speculative novel.
