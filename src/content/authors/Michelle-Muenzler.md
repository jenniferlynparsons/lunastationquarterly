short_bio: Michelle Muenzler, known at local science fiction and fantasy conventions
  as “The Cookie Lady”, writes fiction both dark and strange to counterbalance the
  sweetness of her baking. Her short fiction and poetry can be read in numerous science
  fiction and fantasy magazines, and she takes immense joy in crinkling words like
  little foil puppets. For a dose of squidgy weirdness, check out her novella, "The
  Hills of Meat, the Forest of Bone", at Amazon. Just don't say she didn't warn you...

Michelle Muenzler, known at local science fiction and fantasy conventions as “The Cookie Lady”, writes fiction both dark and strange to counterbalance the sweetness of her baking. Her short fiction and poetry can be read in numerous science fiction and fantasy magazines, and she takes immense joy in crinkling words like little foil puppets. If you wish to lure her out of hiding, you can friend her on Facebook or chase her down at a local SF/F convention where she will ply you with hundreds of home-baked cookies while gleefully describing the latest horror she’s written. She supposes you could also use her website to reach her, but she finds electronic cookies far less tasty than real ones.
