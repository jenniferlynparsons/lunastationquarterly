Dawn Trowell Jones is a speculative fiction writer and poet—formerly a commercial tax preparer, practicing attorney, facilitative mediator, law-student career counselor, and computer programmer. Her writing tends towards the dark—paranormal fantasy and science fiction, even blending the two—stories about new paths, dead ends, and personal narratives that bind. She's had a short story ("The Acquisition") and a poem ("Regret on the Morning After") published, and self-published another short story ("The Secha"). Other stories are in the works. Atlanta, Georgia, is her home, where she lives with her husband and a pair of non-euphonious cats.
