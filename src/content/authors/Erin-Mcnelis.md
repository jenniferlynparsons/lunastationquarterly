short_bio: Erin McNelis has been reading and writing fantasy fiction for as long as
  she can remember. She writes, knits, and plays the viola in Pennsylvania with a
  husband, two children who think they are dragons, and the requisite cat. She writes
  fantasy because she feels freer to explore uncomfortable or unpopular ideas when
  not held fast to all the rules of reality.
