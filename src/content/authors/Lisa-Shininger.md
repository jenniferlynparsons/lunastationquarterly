Lisa Shininger is a writer and designer from Dayton, Ohio. A book-loving space nerd, she likes talking about literature and pop culture only slightly more than experiencing it in the first place. She produces the Apex Magazine podcast, co-hosts the Bossy Britches podcast, and explores all things Jeff Goldblum for Pop Culture Crazy.

Despite their best efforts to convince her otherwise, she is also a Cleveland Browns fan.

You can yell with her on Twitter about literature and pop culture at @ohseafarer.
