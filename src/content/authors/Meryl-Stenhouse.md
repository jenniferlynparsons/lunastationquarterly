Meryl Stenhouse lives in subtropical Queensland where she curates an extensive notebook collection and fights a running battle with the Lego models trying to take over the house. When not avoiding stealth bricks she can be found at the computer, avoiding writing. She has no writing qualifications other than experience, cynicism and an outdated science degree.
