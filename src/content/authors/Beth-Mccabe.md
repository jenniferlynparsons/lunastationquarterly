Beth McCabe has been writing spec fiction for 60 years, if you count the handmade book about wizards she produced at an early age. For part of that time she also wrote marketing copy to pay the mortgage. She and her husband recently moved from New England to Washington's South Puget Sound, where she enjoys chatting about fermenting unusual vegetables instead of how many feet of snow are piled up. She is a graduate of the Barnard College Creative Writing Program, where she placed second in the Elizabeth Janeway Fiction Prize. Her work has appeared inÂ Luna Station Quarterly, Andromeda Spaceways, Halfway Down the Stairs, Liquid Imagination, Brilliant Flash Fiction, Youth Imagination, and other publications.
