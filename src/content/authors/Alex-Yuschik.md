Alex Yuschik writes poetry, short stories, and longer fiction about things she's obsessed with, from lovers who become enemies, engines and religions, to calligraphy and tornadoes. Her work is represented by Bridget Smith of Dunham Literary. In previous lives, Alex has been a besieged summer arts and crafts counselor, Latin scholar, cellist, circulation staffer at a research library, and racer of dark Southern roads in a dark German car. In her current incarnation, she studies Mathematics as a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh and enjoys burritos.
