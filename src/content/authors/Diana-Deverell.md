Diana Deverell was born in Oregon and fled at age eighteen, earning her living as a long-haul trucker, beef farmer, youth worker, and hot/cold war diplomat. Those adventures took place in 48 states, two Canadian provinces, El Salvador, and Poland. Once she’d gathered enough novel material, she moved to Denmark to write fulltime.

Diana publishes three separate international, legal, and thriller novel series and her short fiction appears regularly in Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine, Fiction River Anthology Magazine, Thrill Ride Magazine, and Mystery, Crime & Mayhem. Her short thriller “Payback is a Bitch” was named a Distinguished Mystery Story of 2018 by Otto Penzler, editor of the The Best American Mystery Stories series. The story sets the stage for Bella’s breakout as lead in Diana’s political thriller Bitch Out of Hell.
