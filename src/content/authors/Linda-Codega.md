Linda is a queer twenty-something millennial living and working in the Hudson Valley. They love fandom, pop culture, sailing, tarot cards, and crying in movie theaters. Their short stories have been published in Luna Station Quarterly, Helios Quarterly, and Dark Moon Digest, among others. Their blog posts appear across the web for a number of local organizations and businesses.

They grew up influenced by Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star Wars. When they were in middle school she started reading young adult fiction and never grew out of it. They have been writing fanfiction since fifth grade, when she wrote a poem about Legolas for her school's poetry competition.

Now, Linda loves experimenting with format and trying new things, and is currently working on writing sci-fi and fantasy short stories and novellas.
