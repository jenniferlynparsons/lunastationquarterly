Julia K. Patt does not know what lurks beyond the stars, but she has some theories. Her short stories have appeared or are forthcoming in such publications as Expanded Horizons, Phantom Drift, Escape Pod, Clarkesworld, and Bikes in Space. She is at work on a novel.

When she isn't writing fiction, she does a little of everything: teaching, editing, proofreading, freelancing, and social media management. In her free time, she also edits Seven by Twenty (@7x20), a journal of twitter literature--or twitterature, if you prefer.
