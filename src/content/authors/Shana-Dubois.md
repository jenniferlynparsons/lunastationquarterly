My name is Shana DuBois and I love books. Seeking out new authors and titles is something I carry with me always. Even when I was stationed in Japan while active duty with the Marine Corps I used the opportunity to delve into works in translation from that region.

I am currently working in the wondrous (boring) world of insurance while I pursue my MA in English with a concentration in literary studies. Talking about books is my everything, I hope you'll join me!
