Allison Epstein lives in Chicago, where she works as a marketing copywriter. She is working toward an MFA in fiction from Northwestern University, and also holds a BA in creative writing from the University of Michigan. Her work has been published in Hypertrophic Literary, the Chicago Reader, Pantheon Magazine, The Huffington Post, and others, and she is a regular contributor to the American Book Review. She is represented by literary agent extraordinaire Bridget Smith.

Allison divides most of her time between work, school, and staring at the novel-in-progress that obstinately refuses to write itself. In the time remaining, she enjoys naps, Broadway fandoms, Shakespeare, and looking at weird ceilings around the city.
She is on Twitter at @rapscallison (but should probably be writing instead).
