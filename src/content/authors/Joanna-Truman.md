Joanna Truman is a filmmaker and writer living in Los Angeles, CA.
She is the Associate Creative Director at Soapbox Films in Burbank, CA. She works with clients such as Disney, Pixar, The Muppets Studio, Dreamworks Animation, and others. She has written for and worked on the marketing campaigns for Disneyâ€¢Pixar's Brave and Monsters University, Disney Feature Animation's Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen, Marvel's The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and many more.
She enjoys writing in many mediums from short and long fiction to poetry to screenplays to animation. She loves animals, particularly cats and owls and manatees and elephants and bears. She wishes she could live in a ruined castle with a not-so-reliable staircase, dusty bookshelves and perhaps a few enchantments.
