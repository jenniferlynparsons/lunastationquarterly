Sian M. Jones received an MFA from Mills College in 2004. Her work has appeared in Best New American Voices 2006, The Montucky Review, and The Cheat River Review. She currently lives near Baltimore, Maryland, with her latest rescue cat and her favorite human. She's not a fan of either humidity or social injustice, but there's only one of those she can do anything about right now.
