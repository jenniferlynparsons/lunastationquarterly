short_bio: 'Lara Ek is a Hungarian-American living in China. She speaks enough languages
  for half her fingers (thumbs don''t count), is interested in everything, and writes
  the kinds of things she wants to read: ie, weird speculative things with an emphasis
  on cultural exploration, the societal impact of novums, gender & sexuality, and
  ADVENTURE. Check her out at Amazon and at Goodreads to enjoy more science fiction
  and dieselpunk stories written in 1890''s slang, and a few stories that are not!'
stories:
- The Incident at Women’s Town
