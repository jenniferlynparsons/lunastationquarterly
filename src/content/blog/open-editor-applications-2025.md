I'm excited to be growing our editorial team! LSQ has come such a long way over these fifteen years, and I'm looking for folks who want to be part of discovering what comes next. I've got two editor spots open!

Here's what I'm looking for: people who love speculative fiction, have strong proofreading skills, and can dedicate about 2-4 hours per week to reading and evaluating submissions (this varies over the quarter). It's okay if you haven't edited for a magazine before – what matters most is a love for genre fiction and a good eye for promising stories.

The role would start around March 1st, and you'd be reading about 10-12 stories each month, providing feedback, and helping with proofreading. It's a volunteer position, but it's also a chance to be part of something really special – a grassroots magazine that's been showcasing amazing, emerging voices in SFF for over fifteen years.

If this sounds like something you'd like to be part of, I hope to hear from you! Applications are open from today through February 1st. You can find all the details and apply through this form: [https://forms.gle/jZCqunv36SU2LxAF7](https://forms.gle/jZCqunv36SU2LxAF7)

If you have questions, feel free to reach out via our contact form. I'm looking forward to welcoming some new voices to our editorial team!
