I'm so excited to share this issue with you all. It really surprised me how wildly different these stories are. There's no theme, nothing that ties them all together, except for the fact that they're all excellent and well worth taking a few moments out of your day to enjoy them.

I'm also pleased to share the lovely cover art with you. It's by Erin Ewer. Read on to learn more about her creative process and inspirations in our interview below.

**Tell us a bit about yourself and what got you on the path to being an illustrator. Was there a defining moment that made you decide to make art your career?**

I was always a really creative kid, ever since I can remember I was drawing, painting, writing stories, making my own toys and dolls... Anything I wanted that I didn't have, I just made. In middle school, I became more serious about art, but outside of the obvious things like animation or comic artists, I had no idea it was possible to turn it into a real career. My high school had a decent art program, and I took every course available. By junior year I had completed the program, so my art teachers helped me build advanced independent studies. When Senior year came around and we were being pressured to decide what to do with the rest of our lives, I was at a loss. I knew I was supposed to pick a path and go to college, but it never occurred to me that you could go to school for art. In my mind, school was for learning a profession, and art was just something people did. If you did it well enough, you might be able to make money with it independently, but that was the destination, and I'd always just assumed the road to get there would be unrelated.

Then one day, after seeing a final project I’d submitted, my teacher asked, “Have you ever considered going to school for art?” I remember just being completely dumbfounded for a moment. I blinked and said, “I didn’t know you could do that.” She pointed me toward an upcoming presentation by a local art college, which opened my eyes to the many ways artists shape the world around us. I was excited by this new possibility, but as I considered their course options, nothing quite seemed to fit. Graphic design was too structured and corporate, and while I did want to learn it for practical reasons, after taking a class, I decided it wasn't something I enjoyed, much to my parents' dismay. I took a summer introductory course in Interior Design, which was enjoyable, but it also required skills that I had always struggled with. Every option that utilized artistic skills seemed to lead me away from actual art, and while Fine Art was an option, that road didn't feel like it would lead anywhere at all. My parents wanted me to have stability, and I understood the importance of that, but I didn't want to get an education in a field that would only result in disappointment and lack of fulfillment. If I was going to be disappointed, I figured I might as well save my parents' money and go to a community college.

I arrived at class one day to find that my teacher had taken the liberty of requesting pamphlets from every major art school in the state so I could field more options. One of which was a fine art school, only a 45-minute drive away, and it contained a word I'd never seen before: Illustration. When I read the course description, I knew it was exactly what I'd been looking for. It was real art, the kind I wanted to do. It was also a real job, with a feasible chance at something sustainable, and although it would be less reliable than graphic design, it was reasonably possible. This was something that I was confident fell squarely into my natural strengths—translating ideas into images, working with metaphor and symbolism, and creating images that tell a story. For the first time, I could actually see the road in front of me, and the glittering goal in the distance was my work. I knew it wouldn't be easy, and that it would still take some time to get there, but it was no longer an abstract place somewhere beyond the brambles. It was a fight to get my parents to agree, and while I understood their reservations, it was a fight I was willing to have. I was like a little goblin with a business plan, presenting my 10-year objective to the board for approval, trying to prove it was a viable option. It was a rough month of civil war, but it was the hill I was willing to die on. I felt in my bones that this was it. I heard it screaming at me. I knew that this was the road I was meant to take, and finally, hesitantly, they agreed.

Shout out to mom and dad, whose love and support made everything possible!


**The cover image has got such a powerful quality to it. What was the inspiration for it?**

This piece was a deeply spiritual expression for me, and possibly my most symbolism-heavy work to date. It explores the joining of opposites - life and death, medicine and poison, and also touches on related themes, such as good and evil. These are often seen as binaries, but in truth, the boundary between them is fluid. I’ve long been fascinated by toxic plants, especially how their potency and ability to heal or harm demands an almost spiritual reverence. A toxic plant can be a powerful medicine or a deadly poison, depending on intention, dose, and context. That shifting line is the core of this painting. While creating this work, I was processing and contemplating the old concepts of the Greek Pharmakon, the philosophy of Alchemy, and Veneficium—the spiritual and medicinal use of poisons. When I stumbled across a book on the subject, it gave language and historical context to something I had felt intuitively for years, and this new understanding became the catalyst for this piece. The imagery blends multiple cultural and symbolic references to convey those ideas and the delicate balance they represent. Every aspect of this piece holds symbolic importance, and together they create a fluctuation—the dance of the boundary shifting, as each aspect’s meaning transforms through reflection, shaped by the context of those around it. This painting captures a moment in which the figure is both alive and dead, embodying transformation, opposites in unity, and the power held in liminal space.

**Who are your favorite women illustrators, past or present?**

Over the years, there have been so many that it's difficult to choose just a few. The work of Stephanie Law heavily influenced how I used my paint several years ago when I was still trying to find my style, and she remains one of my all-time favorite watercolor artists. Currently, I am very much enjoying the works of Lauren Marx, Irene Meniconi, Annie Stegg, and Liga Klavina-Raiska, to name just a few that have been at the top of my list lately.

**What is your dream project? If there were no restrictions on time or money what would you create?**

This one is kind of tough, but if I had unlimited time to work on a single project, I'd love to do an Oracle Deck. It's something that I've thought about regularly throughout the years, and I've even made serious attempts at planning it numerous times. Eventually the project gets interrupted, and by the time I revisit it, my ideas have changed and I want to start from scratch again, haha.

**Because LSQ is all about stories I have to ask, what are some of your favorite tales?**

Beauty and the Beast has always held a very special core place in my heart, and folk/fairy tales in general are a huge influence and inspiration for me. Some of my favorite books are "Uprooted" and "Spinning Silver" by Naomi Novik. Her storytelling and writing are phenomenal, and she seems to pull a lot of inspiration from classic fairy tale themes, combining them with her own unique twists.

**What's something you're working on now that you're really excited about?**

I have a few book cover commissions coming up this year that I’m really excited about, though work on them hasn’t started just yet. In the meantime, I’m working on a couple of personal paintings where I’m pushing both my style and comfort zone. I tend to paint in a very tight and controlled way, and for years I’ve been trying to loosen up. It’s not easy for me to let go of that control, but one of the most beautiful things about watercolor is the magic that happens when you let go a little, and let the paint do the work for you. This exercise has been a bit of a challenge, and I constantly have to resist the urge to overwork it, but I’m very pleased by the results so far.
