If I were going to Hogwarts, I would have to be worried about someone putting my name in the Goblet of Fire. Instead, I can very proudly present to you Issue 013 of Luna Station Quarterly. This issue kicks off, yes, the fourth year of publication. So exciting!

I've got three wonderful new Assistant Editors on staff, joining Cheryl Ruggiero are Megan Kaleita, Iona Sharma, and Elizabeth Thurmond. They've done a great job despite getting dropped in during the craziness of the submissions period. I thank them and look forward to having their help on some long-incubating projects.

But you're looking for the stories, aren't you? Allow me to direct your attention to the sidebar on your left. There you will find a link where you can , as always.

If you're feeling generous, please do consider purchasing the ebook. You get three popular formats (EPUB, MOBI and PDF), complete with a fancy cover, and all the proceeds go right back into Luna Station to fund our author payments. All you have to do is click that nice button on the left and fill in your details.

Before I depart and let you get reading, I want to suggest you start with our currently featured story, "" by Sandi Leibowitz. I hope you enjoy it as much as the editors did and when you're done, feel free to read through the rest of the issue!

Thank you so much for your support of women-authored speculative fiction (and that's no small mouthful!). If you'd like to support us further, our donation button is always on and it would be awesome if you spread the word on or .

Enjoy and happy reading!
