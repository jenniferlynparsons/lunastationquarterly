A lot's been going on at LSQ and the world, dear readers, so let's take a moment to get you caught up:

In light of recent news, we want to make it clear that Black lives matter and trans women are women, and are welcome in our community.

Last week, Issue 042 was released! Featuring a dozen delicious stories by emerging women-identifying writers, and available in print and digital formats!

Submissions will open on June 15! This will be for our annual themed issue, so stay tuned for the announcement of this year's theme.

If you like what we do and want to help us keep doing it, we have a Patreon page you can check out! We also have suggestions on other ways to support us here.

Our anthology is still available! The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years is a journey through LSQ's early years, with cover art by the amazing Julie Dillon. Don't miss out!
