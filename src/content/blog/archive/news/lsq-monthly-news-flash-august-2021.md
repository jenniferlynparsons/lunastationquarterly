Another month is upon us, dear readers, and we have quite the news to share!

Time is running out to submit your bird-themed stories! Submissions closeÂ August 15th. As they say, the early bird catches the worm, so don't delay!

If you just can't wait for our special bird issue, we already have a sneak peek of the cover art on Patreon! Take a gander, get some cool rewards, and support a volunteer-run indie mag all in one go!

Our current (and biggest!) Issue 046 is here for your reading pleasure. Packed with 20 stories, it's sure to have something for everyone!

Issue 047 is right around the corner...

Need even more reading to tide you over till then? Check out our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years. Treating yourself was never so much fun!
