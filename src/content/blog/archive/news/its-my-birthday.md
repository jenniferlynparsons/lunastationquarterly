Hi everyone! Jennifer, Editor in Chief here, taking off my official blogger voice and saying hello to you personally.

Today is my birthday! I turn 39 and it's awesome. Don't let anyone tell you that being this close to 40 is scary. It doesn't have to be. Surround yourself with great books, great people, and great work and age becomes simply a way of marking time, not a looming deadline.

Would you like to help me celebrate today?

If every one of you who reads this would go hit our PayPal button and make a donation to LSQ, even if it's only a dollar, I'd be the happiest birthday girl ever.

Every donation from today will go towards getting proof copies for our amazing tactile, hold-it-in-your-hands print editions of Luna Station Quarterly I'll be releasing next year!!!

If you don't have that dollar to spare, please spread the word to others who might.

Want a gift in return? (because birthdays always include presents!) Then you could buy one of my books (this one or this one). Again, all proceeds go to the LSQ proof copy fund!

Thanks and I hope you have a great day!
