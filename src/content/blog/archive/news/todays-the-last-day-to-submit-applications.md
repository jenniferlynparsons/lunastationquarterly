Would you like to read for LSQ? We have openings for new editors. Proofreading skills and good instincts about stories are required, experience is not. Come help us choose the stories to share with our readers!

Our volunteer Editors read through the submitted stories, commenting on each one they read and voting for the ones they consider the best for that issue. Once stories are chosen, editors proofread the final choices before publication.

While a simple job description, this is the core of what makes LSQ run, its individual issues and the stories within are the foundation upon which the whole of LSQ is built.

First time editors welcome. All positions are volunteer. We seek diverse applicants.
