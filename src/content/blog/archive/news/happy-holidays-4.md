No matter what holiday you celebrate, Luna Station Quarterly wishes you all the best in the coming year!

I hope you have a very happy holiday and that the new year brings you joy and prosperity.

I also hope Santa brings you all loads of story ideas, the fortitude to write them, and the strength and courage to send them out into the world.

Keep writing and thank you for all your support this past year.
