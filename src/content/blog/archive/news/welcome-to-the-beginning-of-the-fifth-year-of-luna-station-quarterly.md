I can’t believe it’s been four whole years since I took a good look at the state of the publishing industry and saw a big hole in place of the emerging women writers that should have been there.

Sixteen issues in, there is still a long way to go, but women’s voices are louder and stronger and more united, and getting bigger all the time. It’s awesome to be a part of that.

This year of LSQ kicks off with this extra-large collection of stellar stories. This issue is filled with themes of sacrifice, life, death, and those who manage to stick around long past their sell-by date. Magic, mystery, and some good old fashioned storytelling are in store for you within this collection.

You can start off by reading our new featured story, "Mission Critical" by Deborah Bailey, a brilliant example of the themes and ideas that weave a thread through this issue.

And if you like this, or any of the other stories, please consider helping us out by spreading the word or purchasing an ebook.

Thanks and happy reading!
