The dog days of summer are upon us, but the Quarterly keeps chugging along. Take a minute to keep cool and catch up with us, dear readers!

The deadline for our submission window is fast approaching! You have until August 22nd to get in your high-flyin' and freewheelin' circus themed stories.

Issue 043 is on the horizon, but Issue 042 is still here to fulfill all your speculative fiction needs, in both print and digital formats.

August 9th is National Book Lovers' Day, so why not treat yourself to a copy of our gorgeously-covered anthology? The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years is available in print and digital, and would be a great addition to your literary collection!

We have a Patreon and would love for you to join us! For as little as $1 per month, you can support emerging women authors, and get some fun perks to boot.
