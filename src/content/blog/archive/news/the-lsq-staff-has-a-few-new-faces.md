title: The LSQ staff has a few new faces!
---
Hi everyone!

I'm so pleased to announce some new additions to our staff!

You'll be seeing new columns in the coming weeks by E. Young, A.

E. Ash, T.

D. Walker and Carrie Naughton. They've got a load of great ideas and perspectives and I can't wait to share their posts with you.

A.

E. Ash (who likes being helpful) is also joining the new Social Media team along with Aliisa Percival. They'll be helping myself and Danielle Perry to bring you more fun and interesting reads on Facebook, Twitter and other places.

And then we have Editorial staff additions. Cathrin Hagey and Tara Calaby are filling our two open Assistant Editor positions and will be helping make each LSQ issue the best it can be.

Last, but most definitely not least, I'm grateful to add the talents of Wanda Evans, Sara Lundberg, and Christina Im to the new Special Projects team. These ladies will be helping me prepare some very special print projects coming out next year.

I'm so pleased to have this wonderful new crew aboard. Along with my already stellar team, I look forward to seeing what the next year brings and presenting plenty of awesome stories and essays for you to enjoy.

Happy Reading!

Jennifer
