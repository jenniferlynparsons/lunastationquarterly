Hello dear readers!

LSQ is going through some changes. As you may have noticed, the Managing Editor of this very blog, Cheryl Wollner, has stepped down from her post. Cheryl has been an integral part of the day to day running of LSQ and I couldn't be more grateful to her for all her work. I'm also happy to tell you that she'll be continuing as a regular contributor so you'll still see her byline pop up from time to time.

As you can imagine, we now have a vitally important role to fill her on the LSQ team. We're looking to find someone as quickly as we can, but of course a good fit is key to everything as well.

This is where you all come in!

If you want to learn the ropes and take the reins of LSQ's blog (I have cowpokes on the brain for some reason!) then I heartily encourage you to fill out our application!

You can find out all the details there and if you know someone else who might be interested, please pass the link along!

Help us find the next person to fill this important role!
