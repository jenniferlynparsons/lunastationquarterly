I'm very excited and proud to announce that there are two new awesome ladies joining the LSQ Editorial team!

First up is our new Assistant Editor Andi Marquette, who has a fair number of books to her credit, is probably much smarter than me, and shares my love of comic books. Welcome, Andi!

In addition, I've created a new role and Danielle Perry has agreed to take on the task. As Editorial Assistant, she's going to help me get some amazing things accomplished in the coming year. Welcome, Danielle!

I want to take a moment to thank the current and past editors for their time and energy. Volunteers are hard enough to come by, but good ones are priceless. Thank you all!
