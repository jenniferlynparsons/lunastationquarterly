Dearest readers! Welcome to the monthly news flash, where we list all the pertinent stuff you need to know for the upcoming month, LSQ-wise at least. Here we go:

Issue 037, filled with twelve speculative short stories by women-identifying authors, is out and amazing, so go check it out

Issue 038 will publish in one month, at the start of June

We are currently open for submissions, but will close on May 15

We continue to celebrate our tenth year of publication by releasing behind-the-scenes interviews with staff -- keep your eyes peeled on the blog for more

We are volunteer-run; if you'd like to learn more about ways to help support this publication, go here. On that note, we've recently updated our Patreon incentives and oh, why not sign up for our newsletter?
