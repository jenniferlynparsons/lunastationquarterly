Yup, that cover is pink. I know it's cliche and trust me, I'm more of a blue person myself, so I'm just as surprised as you are. Just go with it.

I'm so proud of this issue and the stories in its pages. You should really go and read it. Here there be fab stuff.

I also will unabashedly, unequivocally encourage you to get your hands on a print copy. The paper quality is great (an important detail!) the price is nice (just $7.95), and it's a nice and chunky 152 pages of brilliant speculative fiction.

For those that dig such things, there's an ebook, too. Links and all that are on the issue page.

Mucho thanks as always to the lovely Erin DeMoss for the illustration that graces the cover. She's so easy to work with and a great supporter of LSQ.

And of course all the gratitude goes out to our stellar editorial staff. Danielle, Cathrin, Andi, Tara, Iona, and Megan help keep all rockets firing throughout the process.

Right, so go and read this thing. You'll thank me.

If you're looking for a place to start, I'll recommend our new featured story, "Planet, Paper, Space" by Melissa Embry.

Enjoy and happy reading!
