We have three wonderful new assistant editors joining our staff! Actually, they joined a little while ago and we are all working to bring you a great new issue on March 1st.

Please join me in welcoming Megan Kaleita, Iona Sharma, and Elizabeth Thurmond! These talented ladies are a great addition to the staff and I'm honored that they've come on board!

You can learn more about them on our page.

See you in a few weeks with Issue 013!
