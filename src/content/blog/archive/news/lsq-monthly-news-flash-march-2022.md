Here's some wild news: LSQ is now 13! Can you believe how fast we've grown? Here are all the other exciting things going on this month:

We published Issue 049! With 18 stories by emerging women writers, this issue is proof that our magazine just keeps on getting better.

Want to see your story in our magazine? Submissions open on March 15th.

Take a look back out our own little slice of women's history this month and pick up your very own copy of our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology!
