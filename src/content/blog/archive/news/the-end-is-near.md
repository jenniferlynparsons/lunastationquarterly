Oh, didn't scare you, did we? We meant the end of the calendar year. Don't be so presumptuous! We've met new friends, grown, and learned so much this year and ooooooooh baby, have we got some stuff up our sleeves for next year which is our tenth year of publication! For now, today, in this moment, we won't dwell on resolutions. We're dwelling instead on stories and writing and how good that makes us feel. With that in mind, have a safe and pleasant New Year's Eve, dear readers. We'll catch you on the flip side.
