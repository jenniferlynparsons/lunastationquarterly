Hello dear readers!

Did you know Luna Station Quarterly is inÂ its 8th year? Awesome right?

We would love to hear your voices and have you be a part of the team. Right now, we're looking for columnists for this very blog. Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, whatever schedule works for you.

If you've got something to say about the worlds of fiction, video games, comic books, illustration or just have an idea for a column written from a female perspective, we'd love to get to know you.

Fill out our application here: https://goo.gl/forms/E0VaTzSC8bjft4zA3

Don't forget we're looking for a volunteer Managing Editor, too. It's an important position with a big megaphone.

If you'd like to boost women's voices and help us amplify POC and LGBTQIA+ writers and artists and you have 3-10 hrs to spare a week, consider applying!
