We're finally in the new year, dear readers, and LSQ is about to enter Year 12! Take a moment to catch up on everything we have going on:

Issue 044 is HERE!!! Take a trip to the circus with our 15 exciting stories by woman-identifying authors. As always, this issue is available in digital and print formats for your reading pleasure.

We are currently open for submissions! Send us your speculative fiction! You have until February 15th!

A new year means new goals, and one of ours is to pay our authors more. You can help us reach that goal by joining us on Patreon, where you can check out some of our other goals, too!

If you're looking for great books to kick off a new year of reading, look no further than our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years. It's absolutely packed with top-notch sci-fi and fantasy stories, and comes in print and digital!
