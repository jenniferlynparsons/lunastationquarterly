Hello dear readers and thanks for joining me as I hit the launch button on the penultimate issue of year 5. I'd like to keep this brief so you can get to reading. That's why you're here after all, right?

This issue has a wonderful mix of mythic fairy tales alongside some very interesting sci-fiÂ encounters. You can read them all right here.

I will start you off by suggesting our first featured story for this issue, "A Sea Without Oysters" by Megan Lee Beals. When you're done with that, there are plenty of other stories in this issue you're sure to enjoy.

Be sure to stop back often for more. We've got a busy blog full of insightful essays for readers and writers alike. We also have a couple great projects in the works. Why not get our newsletter and keep up?

If you like what you've read, share it! If you want to see more, support us! And don't forget you can buy an ebook edition at Weightless Books!

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy the issue. Happy reading!
