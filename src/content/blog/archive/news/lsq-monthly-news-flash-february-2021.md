February may be the shortest month, but LSQ is still jam-packed with activity! Here's what we want you to know this month:

Submissions close on February 15th, which is TWO WEEKS from today! Polish up those stories and get them in now!

Our Issue 044 circus is still open and going strong! Have you gotten your copy yet? We have both print and digital, if you like options.

There's even more LSQ goodness to be found in our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years. Also available in print and digital because options!

If you like what we do, and want to help us keep doing it, consider joining our Patreon. A pledge at any level goes a long way towards paying our authors and keeping things running!
