Looking to see a bit more from our wonderful authors? We've compiled a (growing) list of Links to our authors' Twitter accounts. We do encourage you all to follow them and show your support!

We'll be posting a new page with links to each individual account soon, but for now, you can refer to this post, or go to our own and simply follow our . Authors! If we missed you, please drop us a line!

Before we get to the actual list, let us remind you that we are currently open for submissions for our next issue! Also, most importantly, our featured story of the week is "Locked In" by Amitha Knight. Please do enjoy this great story!
