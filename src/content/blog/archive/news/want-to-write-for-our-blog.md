Luna Station Quarterly is a grassroots, independent magazine with an international readership, dedicated to publishing great genre fiction (sci-fi/fantasy, all that weird stuff that's fun to read, etc.) by emerging women writers. We're about to enter our 6th year of publication!

We support a positive, affirming atmosphere and encourage writers who are just starting out. We publish stories we love, no matter the author's level of experience.

While not an official non-profit, we operate on a non-profit model, with all proceeds of book sales going back into paying story authors and running the website. As such, these are currently "for the love" positions. You can learn a bit more about our future goals on our Patreon page.

As a blogger for LSQ, you'll get hands on experience as well as access to our Editor-In-Chief to pick her brain for technical/publishing questions.

So, that's us in a nutshell, now what are we looking to do?

We want LSQ to grow and to engage on a more active level with our community of authors, but we also want to reach out to readers, to get the attention of non-writers and show what great stuff is going on in the worlds of short stories, genre fiction, and women writers.

What do we need?

We need you! We're looking for writers to help us build on our solid and growing foundation. Interested? Take a look at the description below.

We'll be collecting applications for the next couple of weeks. Expect a decision and start date some time in the next month.

New Bloggers

We're also always on the lookout for columnists, reviewers, and interviewers.

Crossposts from your blogs would be welcome as well, so if you're already writing essays, etc. maybe LSQ can help spread your exposure. All the content you contribute will be posted on the LSQ site and linked on our Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook accounts.

And of course you retain the rights to everything. :) Your bio will be added to the staff section of the site as well.

Specifically, here's what we're seeking:

Columnists/Essayists -

Ideas are welcome for a monthly (or even quarterly) column on something related to books, genre stuff, women in writing, general geekiness, etc.

We would also love random personal essay submissions on pretty much any topic related to books, women, and speculative fiction in some way. So, if you can't commit to a regular schedule, we'd still love to see your piece.

Interviewers -

If anyone is interested in contacting authors and organizing interviews, please let us know! We'd love to involve indie authors, too, including those published by a small press as well as self-publishers.

Reviewers -

Have a favorite book, old or new, that you'd like to write a review for? Already write reviews on your own blog or goodreads? We'd like to see your book reviews.

Qualifications and how to apply -

FIRST TIMERS AND YOUNG AUTHORS ARE WELCOME! LSQ has always been open to emerging and new writers and this is no exception.

Please skim the blog to see the subjects we're already covering. We're looking for something we haven't covered yet, or at least not in great depth. (YA from a young person's perspective, personal essays on books that transformed you, features on women in STEM or profiles of women genre authors would be particularly welcome).

Once you fill out the application, we’ll be in touch and will ask you for a sample of your writing. So, if you're interested in contributing any of the above, either a single piece or as a staff writer, please use this form:
