Dearest readers! Here is what you need to know for all things LSQ in May:

We close for submissions on May 15 so get your wonderful speculative fiction stories to us before then;

Issue 034 will be out June 1!!! Brimming with fabulous fantasy, sci-fi, and things somewhere in between, this issue, like all our others, will feature work by emerging female authors and be available in print, digital, and online;

We are growing! We are ecstatic about adding some new editors to our Quarterly editorial board! More specific welcomes to come to the blog and social media shortly so you can get to know and love them;

And don't forget to celebrate the birthday of author Angela Carter on May 7
