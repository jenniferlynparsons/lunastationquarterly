title: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!

Hello dear readers!

There has been a massive, ongoing emergency within the LSQ family. Everyone is safe, but the repercussions have meant that our blog has been on a temporary hiatus.

Even worse, Issue 030 has been delayed until next week.

My most humble apologies for this. In our 8 year history, this has only happened one other time and I do my personal best to make sure such a thing only happens very rarely.

Be sure to keep an eye out for the issue and some announcements soon!
