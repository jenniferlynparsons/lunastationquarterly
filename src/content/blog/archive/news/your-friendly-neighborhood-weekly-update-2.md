Hello, dear readers!

We want you all to know that we're already well on our way to having another issue packed with great stories on September 1st. Still working your way through this issue? Great! We'd love to hear what you think. Just drop us a line through our contact form.

If you're on some kind of social network, we've got links down there on the right sidebar. +1, like, or tag us, or whatever. Nobody gets paid around here, so your links are what keep us motivated!

This week, our featured story of the week is "Below the Tree Line" by Danica Cummins and we hope you enjoy it!

Just one final announcement, then we'll let you get back on with your reading and socializing (and hopefully, writing!). We've got a lovely, little Twitter feed (and Facebook stream), and we're going to start posting some links to things outside of Luna Station's usual stock and trade. So if you're interested in finding interesting articles and essays about writing, fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. that isn't limited to women authors (although our emphasis is still definitely on empowering women to write!), then follow us. We hope you'll get something from what we have to share.

Have a great week, everyone, and don't forget to keep reading and writing!
