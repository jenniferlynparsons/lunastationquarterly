title: We have a new Managing Editor!
---
This is a week of big announcements (stay tuned for one tomorrow!) and I'm excited about all of them, as you can imagine.

Today's news is about this very blog. For some time, I've felt that handing over the reins would be good for helping LSQ grow and just generally helping the blog get better and better. It's been two years of me handling it on my own, with some capable help and a team of awesome writers, of course. It's been great so far, but I've felt for a while now that I need to put more of my energy into some bigger picture ideas I have for LSQ as a whole.

Which is why I'm very happy to announce that our very own Cheryl Wollner is stepping into the role of Managing Editor for the LSQ blog! We're both excited about the ideas and energy she'll be bringing to the table. Yaaay!

You can read a bit more about Cheryl on her profile, but I'll add a bit to that. :) She brings her passion for women's issues as well as her love of literature and LSQ with her as she takes on this new challenge. I can't wait to see what new vitality she injects into things.

I also want to take a quick moment to thank the other applicants for making my choice quite tough. I'm so grateful that you stepped forward! Thank you!

So take a moment, if you will, and welcome Cheryl in the comments. And be sure to look for her byline on posts in the future. It's sure to be something interesting.
