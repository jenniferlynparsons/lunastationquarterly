Dear readers! Welcome back to the LSQ monthly news flash, where you can find all our goings-on in one convenient place!

We are currently open for submissions until May 15. See our guidelines here.

Issue 041 is still out and still free for all--share it with your friends!

It's National Poetry Month! We have quite a bit of speculative poetry-themed posts on our blog for you to check out.

If you want even more reading material, our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology is available in print and digital!
