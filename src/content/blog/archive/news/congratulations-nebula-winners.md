Women rocked this year's Nebula Awards. If there's something to celebrate, it's that women won in nearly every category (the single exception was the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation which went to Mad-Max Fury Road - a movie starring a woman)!

If you know any nay-sayers for women writing speculative fiction, just show them this list:

Best Novel: Uprooted, Naomi Novik

Best Novella: Binti, Nnedi Okorafor

Best Novelette: “Our Lady of the Open Road,” Sarah Pinsker *available in Asimov 6/2015

Best Short Story: “Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers,” Alyssa Wong *available in Nightmare Magazine 10/2015

Have you read any of these women or their work? The best way to support female authors is to read what they write and celebrate their success. This could be your success next. Congratulations to all the winners!
