For those of you sharing a hemisphere with me, it's quite possibly freezing cold where you are. Here in the North East, it's been single digits lately. All you Southern folk are probably a bit to warm for my taste right about now. All I know is that I've been taking advantage of the weather to curl up with a pile of books and stories. I hope you find the time in your day to enjoy a good tale or two as well.

I'm also popping in here to make a couple announcements, not just chatter on about the weather.

First, our new featured story is  "Alien" by Lauren Kocher. It's part of the great lineup available for your reading pleasure in Issue 016.

If you've got a story to share, maybe something like Lauren's, we are also still open to submissions until January 15th. You can find out all the details on the .

As always, if you'd like to support LSQ and the women authors we publish, you can buy a copy of the issue, make a donation, or simply spread the word on your favorite social media outlet. Thanks for your support!
