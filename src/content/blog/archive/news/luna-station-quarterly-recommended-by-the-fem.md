The Fem, recommends Luna Station Quarterly as an inclusive/feminist journal to submit to! We are thrilled and honored to be recognized as a publication which values a diversity of female voices. We're in good company, listed among international journals, such as Room, (publishing since 1975), As/Us Journal (publishing women of color and indigenous authors), and Quaint, (publishing work by female-identified and genderqueer/non-binary people). The Fem's full list is an impressive array of inclusive feminist publishing.

Thank you to all the people of LSQ that make this recognition possible. We would not be able to publish inclusive work without the incredible submissions we receive. Check out Issue 27 and marvel at what female authors are writing.

We're open for submissions for Issue 29. Send us your inclusive stories, your feminist stories. For guidelines and more information see our submittable page.

If you're a female writer of color, we'd love to hear from you! We'd love for you to apply as a blogger for our Write Inclusive Campaign where we feature bloggers of color.

We hope that everyday LSQ can grow to be a more inclusive space for female readers and writers of speculative fiction.
