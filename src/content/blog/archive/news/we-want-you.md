Yes, YOU. We have two new announcements as we continue to grow and seek out new women-identifying writers.

Firstly, we're looking for new bloggers to join our blog team. Whether you have a one-off essay idea or are interested in contributing monthly to a regular column, we're interested in hearing your ideas. See our application for more information.

Secondly, we're searching for an additional assistant editor for the Quarterly. No editing experience is necessary, but you must have decent proof-reading skills. See the application for more details.

All positions are volunteer as we are a small but mighty grassroots organization. Help make us mightier by joining up! Thank you!
