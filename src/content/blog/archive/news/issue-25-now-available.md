Luna Station Quarterly is pleased to announce Issue 25. Our seventh year of publication and we continue to say that stories written by female authors matter. Stories that disrupt our sense of reality, that unravel the normalcy around us, matter.

If you want to read about selkies and alternative histories you've come to the right place. If you want to embrace the incredible strides and risks female authors are taking in speculative fiction, you've come to the right place.

We welcome you. Today and every day you return, whether to our publication, to our blog orÂ to our anthology, we welcome you. Welcome to Issue 25. Please enjoy your stay.
