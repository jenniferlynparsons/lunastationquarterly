Here is it! Your one-stop-shop for LSQ news. Here's what you need to know this month:

We are looking for new bloggers to join our blog team! Have ideas? Like to write about those ideas? Then check out the application here.

We are also looking for a volunteer assistant editor for the Quarterly! Take a peek at the application and see if you're interested in applying.

Issue 034 was published June 1 and is still available online and in print, so check it out! It's filled with eight awesome stories by women-identifying authors and has a lady meerkat on the cover, so yeah, it's pretty great.

Our submissions are open for Issue 036. This will be our first-ever themed issue and the theme is . . . . crones. So please read the submission guidelines and send your stories featuring crones to us by Aug. 15.

Issue 035 will be out September 1!
