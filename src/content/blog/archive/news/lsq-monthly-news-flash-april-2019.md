Attention dear readers! Here's the latest LSQ news you need to know.

Issue 037 is out now, filled with 12 speculative fiction short stories by women-identifying authors. It's fantastic - go check it out and spread the word!

Issue 038 will publish at the start of June.

We are open for submissions until May 15. Send us your best, but please read the guidelines first.

At the start of the month, we launched our upgraded website. It's shinier, sharper, and easier to navigate, if we do say so ourselves.

We've updated our Patreon -- give it a check and see if you'd like to become a Patron. We're a volunteer-led organization with no ads and we pay our authors. We'd like to continue to grow.

For those on the east coast, DC's Awesome Con is set for April 26 to 28.
