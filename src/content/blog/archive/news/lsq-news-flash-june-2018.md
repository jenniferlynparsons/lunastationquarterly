Dearest readers! Here is what's going on here at Luna Station Quarterly this month.

Issue 034 came out last Friday, June 1!!! Available on-line and in print, this beautiful issue features eight speculative fiction short stories by women-identifying authors. Go check it out and share with others!

We are currently closed for submissions, but will re-open on June 15. Here's a sneak peek, though: this time around, our subs will have a theme! Stay tuned!!!

Thank you to all who expressed interest in being an editor for the Quarterly -- we have some new staff on board and will be giving them a proper welcome and introduction soon!
