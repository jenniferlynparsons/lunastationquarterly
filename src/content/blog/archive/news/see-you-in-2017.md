LSQ is taking a blogging break for the holidays, but we'll be back January 2nd with more insights and news on emerging female authors and speculative fiction!

In the meantime, check out our current issue. If you like what you read, please join our Patreon to further support female authors. Your help will provide a paying market for the authors we publish (currently $5 per author, but we want to increase that amount).

See you in 2017 and happy holidays for all who celebrate!
