What are we up to at LSQ this month? Allow us to tell you all about it:

Our submissions are open until November 15th. Flex those creative muscles and send us your best!

We're still working our way through our hefty Issue 047 and would love to have you along for the ride! With 19 speculative fiction stories by emerging women writers, there's a little something for everyone, and you can snag your very own copy in print or digital formats.

October is National Book Month! If you're looking to add something pretty to your shelves, might we suggest our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology? In addition to a gorgeous cover, the contents are top-notch quality as well!

If you want even more LSQ fun, consider joining us over on Patreon! Our EIC shares fun tidbits from all over the Internet, as well as behind-the-scenes production content. Patrons who pledge a little more also get early access to new issues!
