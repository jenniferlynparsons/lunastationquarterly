Hi everyone!

Just a quick note here. Those in charge of putting the posts together (namely, me) have just finished a whirlwind of job interviewing and finishing up Camp NaNoWriMo and need a bit of a breather.

We'll return on Monday with our regularly scheduled programming, but for now, please do enjoy the archives. There has been some outstanding writing on here over the last couple of weeks.

Enjoy, and if you like what you see, please consider a donation or patronage, or buy an ebook. We thrive on your support.

Thanks and have a great weekend!
