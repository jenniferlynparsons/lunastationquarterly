If you’ve liked what you’ve been reading from our authors this past week, why not become an LSQ author yourself? Submissions for the March 2016 issue open September 15th.  It's free to submit, but before submitting, please read our submission guidelines to understand what we're looking for. And, it wouldn’t hurt to take one more look at the work we’ve published in our archived and current issues. Issue 23, for instance, might be a great place to start.

Whether this is your twentieth story published or your first, we want dedicated female authors with incredible speculative fiction stories to tell. If this sounds like you, then you’re our kind of writer. Submissions for the March 2016 issue open September 15th.
