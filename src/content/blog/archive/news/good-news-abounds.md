This is the first of a few upcoming posts delivering exciting news from the LSQ editorial team. Yay!

I'd like to announce that Danielle Perry is now a full Assistant Editor!

Danielle has been Editorial Assistant for some time now and is invaluable helping out with Twitter and Facebook and the rest. She also helps proofread the issue before it gets into your hot little hands and always catches those final little typos.

Now she's also helping to read all the great submissions our writers send in.

Thanks, Danielle, for taking this responsibility on and with gusto!
