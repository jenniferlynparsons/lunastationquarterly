Dearest readers! Happy New Year! We have loads of surprises up our sleeves throughout this entire year, so stay tuned for the latest news with our monthly news flash and our social media feed (@lunaquarterly). Here's the 4-1-1 for this month.

We are currently open for submissions of speculative fiction short stories until February 15. Check out our guidelines here.

Our latest issue (and first ever themed issue: crones!) -- Issue 036 -- is out now and fantastic. Go check it out. Issue 037 will be published March 1.

Don't forget to celebrate Hedy Lamarr's birthday on January 19.

And to save the biggest news for last: Luna Station Quarterly has entered our tenth year of publication. We could not be more excited and proud of the decade of stories by women authors that have passed through our pages. That said, in celebration, we have several things planned for this year, one of which is a re-design of this very blog . . . coming soon. Stay tuned, dear readers, and thank you from the bottom of our lunar hearts for all the love and support you've given our little publication.
