What's going on at Luna Station this month, you ask? Look below, and all will be revealed...

We are currently open for submissions! You have until November 15 to send us your lovelies, and we so very much want to read them!

Need inspiration? Perhaps you'll find it in Issue 043, which is free to read online. It's also available to purchase in digital and print, and let's face it, who wouldn't want to own a hard copy with that stunning cover image by Christina Kraus?

In honor of the spookiest month, we're sharing the spooky stories we've published over the years! Ranging from slightly creepy to utterly terrifying, there's something for everyone in our archives. Be sure to follow us on Twitter so you don't miss out!

As always, our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology is available in print and digital for those of you who want even more LSQ goodness.

If all of the above sounds great to you, then consider joining us over on Patreon! Thanks to our patrons, our basic operating costs are covered, but we have so many more goals we want to reach, like a pay raise for our authors. Any and all pledges are greatly appreciated. And most importantly, if you enjoy our work, please spread the word so others can join in on the fun!
