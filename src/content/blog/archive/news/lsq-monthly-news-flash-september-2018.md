Hello, dearest readers! The editorial staff here at Luna Station has been busy finishing up our latest Quarterly issue and  we couldn't be more excited to share it with you all. Let's get September off to a great start, shall we? Here's the need-to-know for this month:

Issue 035 will be out this Wednesday, September 5! Mark your calendars for some prime reading time. The issue, as always, will be available both online and in print.

Submissions will re-open on September 15.

Have an idea for the blog? We are always interested in hearing from potential new bloggers to join our online team. Check out our application here.

Issue 034 is still available! With eight speculative fiction stories inside, it's a great companion to your other SFF reads.
