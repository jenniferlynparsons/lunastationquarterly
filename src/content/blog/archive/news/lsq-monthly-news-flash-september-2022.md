Welcome the the third quarter of Year 13! Here are all the things we’re up to this month:

We just released Issue 051! Loaded up with 15 stories by emerging women authors, and sporting a truly gorgeous cover, this issue is sure to satisfy all your reading desires.

We’re looking for some new columns to add to our blog! If you, or someone you know, have a particular topic you’re passionate about and want to get the word out there, we’d love to add you to the blogging team! Check out the application for more details.

Our next submission window opens September 15. Start polishing those stories!

There’s even more LSQ fun to be had on our Patreon, from behind-the-scenes production to fun tidbits shared by our EIC. All pledges go right back into the quarterly and help us pay our authors!

If you just can’t get enough LSQ, be sure to check out our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology. It comes in print AND digital, and it’s packed with 50 of our best stories from Years 1-5.
