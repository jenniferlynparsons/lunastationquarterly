Do you hear the hoofbeats? Do you feel the soft muzzle? Do you see the beautiful mane? We’re talking about HORSES, of course.

For this year’s themed issue, we’re looking exclusively for stories featuring horses, filtered through the lens of Luna Station’s mission, of featuring female-fronted speculative stories. As always, we encourage you to dig deep, to go beyond the obvious. Set your horse-related stories somewhere unique in time or space, give it a unique twist, surprise and delight us!

As usual, all of our normal submission guidelines apply, just with a bit more hooves this time!

Find out more on our new submissions site.
