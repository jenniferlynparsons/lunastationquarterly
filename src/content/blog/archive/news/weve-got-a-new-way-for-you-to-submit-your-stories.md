Hello everyone!

I'm here to get you up to speed on some behind the scenes work that has been going on here at LSQ HQ (i.e. my house). We've decided not to continue our contract with Submittable at this time. The cost for an operation our size is simply far too high and we would rather make use of our generous Patreon supporter's funds elsewhere (more on that to come in future announcements).

If we're no longer using Submittable, then how will authors submit their stories? Well, I've built a new submissions manager, customized for LSQ. You can find it here. It works quite simply. Fill out the form, paste your story into the box, and hit the submit button, after reading our submission guidelines, of course.

Other than where you're submitting your stories, there's really no other changes to our process. Our deadlines remain the same, our editors will still read all your submissions, and we'll continue to publish the wonderful women-identified writers that come through our door.

If you have any questions, please feel free to use our contact form and I'll get back to you ASAP.

Thank you all for your support!
