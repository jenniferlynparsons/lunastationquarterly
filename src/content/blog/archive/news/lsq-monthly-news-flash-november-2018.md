Short. Sweet. To the point. That's how we like our news flashes here at Luna Station. Here's what we have for you this month:

Our call for submissions closes on November 15, so get your speculative fiction beauties submitted to us soon!

Our Issue 035 came out September 5 and is still going strong with sixteen stories to entertain, enlighten, and sometimes spook you. Go check it out!

Our Issue 036 comes out December 1.

Imperative side note: Issue 036 is our first ever themed issue and the theme is Crones.

Second imperative side note: Issue 036 wraps up our ninth year of publication. Which means only one thing. . . starting with Issue 037 in 2019, we're entering our tenth year of publishing and supporting women writers. We. Have. Big. Plans. [editorial mwahahahahahahaha!] -- Stay tuned!

Oh and hey -- November is NaNoWriMo, you know: National Novel Writing Month, the fever dream where you try to slam out a draft of a novel within one month. Are you participating this year???
