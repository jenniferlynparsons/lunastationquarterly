News, LSQ-style. Right here, right now, directly to your little eyeballs. Here's what's up this month:

In case you missed it, we published our Issue 035 on September 5. Available both online and in print, this beauty has 16--yes 16!--speculative fiction short stories by women-identifying authors.

We are currently open to submissions. Go here to check out our guidelines. We will close to submissions on November 15.

December 1 is the date of our next issue, 036. This one is special indeed, as it will be our first ever themed issue: crones. We can't wait for you to see it.

East coast events this month include the New York Comic Con October 4 through 7 and the Boston Book Festival on October 13.
