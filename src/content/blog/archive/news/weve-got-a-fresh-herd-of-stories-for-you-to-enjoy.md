Can you hear their thundering hooves? Have you caught a glimpse of a long, spiral horn? If you have, you may have figured out that our December issue has a very powerful theme: Horses!

Horses loom large in our collective histories. Symbols of power, of strength, companions on a long journey, heroes, magical creatures, etc. they’re woven through the fabric of our tales.

All this love of horses is pouring out here and now, the obvious inspiration for this year’s theme. There’s such a wild and varied selection of stories in this issue, tales full of magic and mayhem, court intrigues and cybernetic mounts. And of course, a few unicorns for good measure. It’s nothing less than you might expect from a stories centered on a creature with such presence in the tales we’ve told around a fire for millennia. We hope you enjoy the ride.
