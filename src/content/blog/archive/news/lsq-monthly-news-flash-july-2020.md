Can you believe we're halfway through the year? While you're processing that bit of information, please allow our monthly news roundup to soak into your brain as well:

Issue 042 is still here and still rockin'!  You can read 12 enthralling stories by emerging women writers in our gorgeous print edition, or in digital format for all our eBook lovers out there.

We are now open to submissions for our annual themed issue. This year's theme: the circus! Send us your silly, whimsical, fantastical stories by August 22!

Our blogger application is still open! If you have something, or several somethings, you want to voice, we'd love to be your platform. Check out the details and apply!

Our Patreon helps us keep things running smoothly, and allows us to pay our lovely authors, so if you can and would like to support us further, please check out our page. We would absolutely love to be able to pay our authors more!

If you want even MORE LSQ, you can still snag a copy of our gorgeous anthology! The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years is available in print and digital and waiting just for you!
