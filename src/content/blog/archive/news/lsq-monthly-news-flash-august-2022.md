Things are moving and shaking here at LSQ! Read our updates and stay in the loop:

Submissions for our tree-themed issue close soon! You have until August 15thÂ to get those stories in.

Our next issue is in production, but in the meantime you can catch up on our milestone 50th issue! There are 18 excellent speculative stories to keep you company in the dog days of summer.

Curious what goes on behind the scenes at LSQ? Check out our Patreon, where our editor-in-chief updates our patrons on everything that goes into putting our stellar publication together.

LSQ has been getting some attention! One of our newer columns, "The Grey Lenswoman," has gotten a shoutout by the president of the Heinlein Society, AND was given a spot in the Speculative Fiction Showcase! Congrats to blogger K. G. McAbee and all her fantastic work.

For even more LSQ fun, take a look at our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years. A fond little trip down memory lane was never so much fun!
