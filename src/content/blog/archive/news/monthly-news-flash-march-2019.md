Dearest readers! Here's your latest and greatest news flash on what's hot over here at LSQ.

Issue 037 went LIVE last Friday, March 1. Go check out twelve fantastic speculative fiction short stories by women authors! Go!

This Issue 037 also marks the official start to our tenth year of publication!

Subs re-open March 15 -- go read the guidelines and send us what fits.

Last week we launched our updated, fresh, glossy, and so so pretty new website and we are ECSTATIC and wearing party hats all month long.

We continue to bring stories and blog posts to your eyeballs free of ads. This means we have a Patreon. *cough*
