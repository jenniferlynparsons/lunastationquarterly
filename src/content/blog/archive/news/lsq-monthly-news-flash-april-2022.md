Exciting things are happening at Luna Station, dear readers! Read on to stay up-to-date with your favorite lit mag.

Submissions are open until May 15! Plenty of time to polish up those gems and send them our way.

Did you know we have a Patreon? For as little as $1 a month, you can support our volunteer-run indie publication, and help us pay our authors more!

Issue 049 is here and it’s fabulous! Packed with 18 excellent speculative stories by 18 excellent women authors, it’s sure to bring you endless reading enjoyment.

For even more reading enjoyment, check out our anthology! We picked the best stories from our first five years, all wrapped up in a gorgeous cover.
