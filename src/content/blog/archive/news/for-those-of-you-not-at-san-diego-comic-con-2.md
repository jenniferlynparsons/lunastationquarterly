Luna Station Quarterly humbly offers up our featured story this week: "The Devil Wants A Word" by Rebecca Bohn. Please do go and enjoy it!

We've got no big announcements this week, so we'll keep this update short. We're still open for submissions for another three weeks (until August 15th) so keep writing! We'd love to see your work. We'd also like to thank all of you who have retweeted or shared a link to LSQ. Your support keeps us going!
