February, already? Time flies when you're having fun, right? Here's everything we're up to at LSQ this month:

We have a survey up on our Patreon we'd like for you to fill out! Whether you're already a patron or thinking of joining, we want to hear your thoughts about what you'd like to see from us.

Our submission window closes onÂ February 15th. Don't miss out on sending us your stories!

As always, we have an open call for bloggers! If there's a topic you love to write about or want a place to post your reviews, check out the application.

Are you familiar with our best-of anthology from our first five years? It's packed with 50 tales from women writers, with cover art from Hugo Award-winning illustrator Julie Dillon!
