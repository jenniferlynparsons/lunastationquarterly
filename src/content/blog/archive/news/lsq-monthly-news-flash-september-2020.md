It's the first Monday of the month, dear readers, which means it's time for another news flash! Keep up-to-date on all things Luna Station as we kick off a new quarter.

Issue 043 is HERE and it is ready for your reading pleasure! We have print, we have digital, we have print and digital!

Submissions open on September 15. Get those stories ready!

September is Self-Care Awareness Month. Our editor-in-chief Jennifer Lyn Parsons created selfcare.tech, a resource for web developers (and non-web developers, too!) You can check it our for invaluable self-care tips, so we can all end this month feeling a little better than when we started.

If you like what we do, and want to help us keep doing it, consider supporting us on Patreon! You can support us other ways, too, if Patreon's not your thing.

Just can't get enough of LSQ?? You can bring home your very own copy of our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years in either print or digital format for even more reading fun.
