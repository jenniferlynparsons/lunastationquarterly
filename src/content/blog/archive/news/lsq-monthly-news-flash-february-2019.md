Extra! Extra! Luna Station has breaking news for you, all conveniently located in this monthly news flash:

Submissions are open until February 15 -- get 'em in while you still can!

Issue 036 is still out and still lovely -- go check out 13 speculative fiction stories by women authors.

Issue 037 will be out March 1.

March 1 will also be the launch date of our updated website! This is huge, folks, and we're so excited to share our new face with you. We'll still have the same info, same blog, same overall feel, but in a slicker, updated format.

While we (im)patiently wait for March 1, we're hosting an A to Z countdown this month to help speed things along. Follow #LSQRollCall on social media (e.g., our Twitter feed at @lunaquarterly) for each day's letter and corresponding author. For example, today, February 4, is the letter "D", for Florence Carpenter Dieudonn√©.
