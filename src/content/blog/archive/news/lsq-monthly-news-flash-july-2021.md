Wondering what's happening here at LSQ this month? We're all atwitter about it and would love to keep you in the loop!

Submissions for our annual themed issue are open until August 15th! This year's theme is BIRDS! Get your wings flapping and your words flowing!

We already have some pretty spectacular cover art picked out for our birds issue! It's up on our Patreon for patrons of all reward levels, along with some other fun stuff. Help support an independent, volunteer-run publication in exchange for sneak peeks!

We're still loving Issue 046, our biggest issue yet! It's absolutely packed with quality stories, and it's available in print and digital formats so you can take it pretty much anywhere. The perfect summer reading companion!

For even more summer reading fun, why not check out our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years? Sitting at 50 of our best stories, it's a great addition to any bookshelf.
