Welcome, dear readers, to the Luna Station monthly news flash! Normally we share news on the first Monday of every month, but this month it was postponed because...

Issue 041 is out!!! Fifteen speculative fiction stories by sixteen women authors, with a sumptuous cover to boot.

Submissions open March 15th. Get those stories ready!

We're always open to onboarding new bloggers. If you have an idea for a column, pitch it our way!

It's Women's History Month and Small Press Month! What better time to support your favorite women-run, women-supporting community? We have a Patreon and other ways to support us. If you have spec fic-loving family or friends, be sure to spread the word!

As always, our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology is available in print and digital!
