Wow! Four years, all wrapped up with a bow. Thank you to all our readers and supporters for making LSQ what it is today!

I've got a couple of fun things in the cooker for year 5 and I can't wait to show you them. For now, I'm just going to be very satisfied in handing this lovely issue over to you.

The stories within this issue look to the sky, to the past, to the future, to love lost and courage won. Tales of wonder and sorrow and joy.

To start you off, I highly recommend reading our first featured story from this issue, and then do continue reading the rest of the issue.

If you'd like to support LSQ, we have an ebook available (actually, the download gets you three formats: PDF, EPUB, and MOBI for your Kindle) for just $2.99. You can also follow us on  and like us on.
