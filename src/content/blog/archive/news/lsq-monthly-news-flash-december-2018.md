Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Here's the must-know for Luna Station this month:

Issue 036 will be published this Wednesday, December 5. This issue of course is awesome and we can't wait for you all to read it, but doubly so because it is out first-ever themed issue: crones!

To piggy back on the item above, for the month of December, some of our blog posts will follow the crone theme in celebration of older women everywhere and their portrayals in media.

Issue 035 is, of course, still available and still lovely so go read that, too.

We are currently closed to submissions but will re-open on December 15.

We are looking for a few editors for the Quarterly! If interested, check out the application -- applications close December 17.
