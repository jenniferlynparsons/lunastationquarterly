Things are a little different at LSQ this month, but our news roundup is here to keep you informed!

As you may know, Issue 044 is delayed until December 15th. However, Issue 043 is still here to keep you company while you wait!

December 15th is going to be a big day. Not only is Issue 044 being released, but we also open to submissions!

Looking for the perfect holiday gift for the SFF-lover in your life? Or maybe even yourself? We just so happen to offer yearly subscriptions! It's the gift that keeps on giving the whole year.

Another great gift idea is our anthology, The Best of LSQ: The First Five Years. Comes in a gorgeous print edition that would look great on anyone's shelves!

If, perhaps, you'd like to give us a gift, our Patreon is always open to new members! It helps us stay in operation and pay our authors. Besides, we've been very good this year, haven't we?
