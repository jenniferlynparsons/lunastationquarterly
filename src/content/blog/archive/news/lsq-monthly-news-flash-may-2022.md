Year 13 is chugging along and we're so glad you're here with us for the ride! Here are some things going on at LSQ for the month of May:

Our submission deadline is fast approaching! Get your stories in byÂ May 15th or forever hold your peace (or at least until the next submission window...)

Have you read Issue 049? It's one of our best yet, with 18 stories by emerging women writers. Grab your own copy in print or digital formats!

For more of our best, check out our anthology of our first five years, also in print and digital!

If you'd like to support us even further, check out our Patreon where we share behind-the-scenes scoops and other fun tidbits!

We're always looking for bloggers to join the team! Check out the application if there's a topic--or several!--that you're passionate about.
