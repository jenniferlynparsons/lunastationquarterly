Hear ye, hear ye, this just in! Extra, extra, read all about it! Insert any other retro newsie shout out here! We've got the latest LSQ news right here, right now.

We are currently open to submissions for our December 2019 issue. Important note: this will be our second ever themed issue with the theme being "Poisons &amp; Potions." We want to see your best speculative fiction short stories using that theme!

A corollary to the first item: subs will close on August 15 and will re-open for our March 2020 issue (no theme) on September 15.

Our next issue (Issue 039) will come out September 2.

Our Patron participation perks continue to grow and change. Consider helping support us!

As we continue to celebrate 10 years of publishing this year, we're proud to publish a beauty of a thing: an anthology from our first five years. Check it out here.

Our blog continues to feature new content about writing, reading, and general speculative fiction topics from any medium Monday through Friday. Interested in blogging for us? Apply today!
