Dear readers! Here's what you need to know about LSQ for the last month of the year.

Last Monday, December 2, we released our Issue 040! A few epic things about this issue:

Its release fully marks our 10th year in publication;

It is our second ever annual themed issue, with the theme of Potions &amp; Poisons;

It's filled with 14 amazing short stories by woman-identifying authors.

We will be back open for submissions on December 15;

Our next issue (Issue 041) will drop at the start of March 2020;

Our ed-in-chief Jennifer Lyn Parsons has been a planning madwoman lately. Be on the look-out for exciting LSQ news in the new year!
