And thus a new issue of LSQ makes its way into the world. Of course this doesn't just happen spontaneously. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes.

Authors submit a multitude of stories. Editors choose the very best. The issue is proofread, there is a whole process to get the print and ebooks editions laid out. Sara Kipin provides a gorgeous cover.

Every time I get to hit publish, I'm grateful for everyone involved.

And now it's in your hands. A batch of marvelous new stories to read and enjoy.

If you like what you see, please buy a copy. The print edition is gorgeous and all sales go to pay for future issues. Even better, consider joining us as a patron!

At the least, share it with a friend and help these stories find their readers.

Now, off you go. Enjoy some fab reading.
