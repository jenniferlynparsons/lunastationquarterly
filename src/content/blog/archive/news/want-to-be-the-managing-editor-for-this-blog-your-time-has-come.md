Hi everyone! Yes, you read that headline right. I am on a search for a managing editor for this very blog.

Over the last couple of years the LSQ blog has grown up big and strong, which is lovely. However, there are some wonderful, amazing big vision projects that I have for LSQ as a whole that have been pushed to the back burner in favor of keeping up with the day to day tasks.

The time has finally come to pass the reins of the blog over to someone else so I can bring these other plans to fruition.

So, I am seeking a passionate editor to run our blog on a volunteer basis. Candidates should have a knack and love for writing and editing, a passion for scifi/fantasy and associated fields/mediums, and a desire to uplift women writers and fans.

New editors are welcome to apply. Passion about the project and the ability to learn quickly will outweigh lack of experience.

This is a chance to be deeply involved in an amazing resource for women in speculative fiction, fans and writers alike. I look forward to working with you.

If you're interested, you can find out more details and fill out the application here.

If you know someone else who might be interested in the position, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!

Thanks so much!
