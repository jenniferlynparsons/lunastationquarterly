Our eighteenth issue features stories in settings both familiar and strange. The characters within are as different as can be, yet they all face hard decisions, their pasts haunting the present as a spectre, sometimes literally!

If you're looking for a place to start, why not take a look at our first featured story from this issue: "The Sacrifice" by Robin L. Martinez.

This issue is also a celebration of another milestone for LSQ. We've published our 200th author! I'm grateful for all the magical, kickass stories within these pages and am honored to continue publishing the talented ladies that write them. Here's to the next 200!

If you enjoy the stories in this issue (or any of our back issues), please consider supporting LSQ and its authors. You can buy an ebook on Weightless Books, share a link on Facebook, Twitter, etc. (just click one of the icons below), or even submit a story yourself!

If you'd like to do a little more, we've also started a Patreon campaign. You can find out more here.

Thanks for your support and enjoy the stories!
