Year 13 is barreling down the tracks, and this month we have lots of exciting news to share:

We've hit yet another milestone! That's right, Issue 050! With 18 stories by emerging women authors, there's a little something for everyone. Grab yourself a copy and celebrate with us! As a bonus, this issue has our very first traditionally drawn cover art, by Theodora Capat.

Submissions open on June 15th for our annual themed issue, and we're sharing the theme early: TREES! Yup, those leafy green giants that make our oxygen! We can't wait to see what you crafty writers do with this one.

If you like what we do, and want to help us keep doing it, we have a Patreon! For as little as $1 a month, you can support an independent, volunteer-run magazine, get behind-the-scenes looks at our production process, and help pay women authors.

As always, for even more LSQ reading pleasure, we offer our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology. It’s packed with all our best stuff, and it’s all wrapped up in a beautiful cover by award-winning artist Julie Dillon!
