While 2017 has had some major ups and downs, the staff here at Luna Station Quarterly endeavor to look at the year in passing as one of personal growth, self-discovery, and damn good writing. We are celebrating our eighth year (and counting) in publication; four amazing Quarterly issues (029, 030, 031, and 032 -- all available online so please do check them out!); some goodbyes to much loved staff and hellos to new folks; and a re-launch to this very blog. Looking ahead to 2018, let's just say we have some big things (good big things) planned for our publication and site and we feel extremely fortunate to be able to move forward with all the support and good vibes we feel every day from our readers. So with that, happy 2018!
