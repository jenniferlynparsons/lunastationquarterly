It is going to be very hard holding back pushing 'publish' on Issue 007, I have to tell you. We have a great round of awesome, fun, thought-provoking, and wonderfully-written stories to share with you next issue. Can you tell I'm excited?

For now though, Issue 006 is still live and our featured story of the week is "" by Eva Eliav. Please do go and enjoy it, it's great reading for a quiet Sunday.

And now the part where you all come in:
