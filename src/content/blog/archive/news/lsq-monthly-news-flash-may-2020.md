It's the first Monday of the month, which means it's time to catch up with everything going on here at Luna Station!

Submissions are open until May 15. There's still time to get your stories in!

Our Patreon has taken a bit of a hit lately. If you want to support an 11-year-old women-run publication dedicated to uplifting and paying emerging women authors, and have the means, please check out our page and consider becoming a patron!

For the month of May, our editor-in-chief Jennifer Lyn Parsons is selling her new book, Take On Me, for half price ($1.50!), with all proceeds directly supporting Luna Station Quarterly.

Issue 041 is still sitting pretty, ready for your reading pleasure.

Issue 042 will be here before you know it! Look for it at the start of June.

Our anthology is still available in print and digital! Check out our gorgeously-covered Best of LSQ: The First Five Years for even more reading fun!
