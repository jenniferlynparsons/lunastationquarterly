I am stepping down as blog managing editor for LSQ. It has been a pleasure to work with our array of talented bloggers and editors. To all our bloggers, thank you for supporting an inclusive future for publishing. LSQ is the place for feminist genre fiction and our bloggers, published authors, editors and, of course, readers make that possible.

Though I am resigning as the blog managing editor, I will still contribute to LSQ as a monthly columnist. We need to promote female writers of speculative fiction and female writers of diverse backgrounds however we can. While I am no longer in a position to devote the time to LSQ to remain a part of the editorial team, I stand behind what editor Jennifer Lyn Parsons says to open Issue 29:

With the world as it is, we need stories more than ever. Stories that lift us up, that take us to new places, that hurt us and build us back up again. We need strong fresh voices, unafraid to go deep, to bring these stories into the light. And we need you, to be curious, to feel everything, to get past the trappings of superheroes and fairy tales and androids and timey wimey stuff to the beating heart of our shared humanity, which these stories exhibit in droves.

Welcome to year eight of Luna Station. Weâ€™ve been expecting you.

I will always believe in the power of stories! I hope you do too. Right now, LSQ is entirely volunteer. In the future, we hope to be able to pay our writers, bloggers and editorial staff for their work and dedication to a feminist future. If you like what we do, consider donating to our Patreon or buying issue 29 (or a back issue of the journal).

Keep an eye out for more information on the search for a new blog managing editor. Whoever LSQ chooses for the role will join a team of positive and creative individuals making the world a better place one word at a time.
