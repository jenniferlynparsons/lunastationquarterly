Submissions! Issues! Subscribing! Supporting! All your LSQ news is HERE.

Submissions are OPEN for our themed December issue. Did we say themed? Yes: Poisons and Potions!

Issue 038 came out June 3 and we are in love with it. It's filled with 13 speculative fiction short stories by women-identifying authors. Go read it! Shoo!

Issue 039 will be published in September.
