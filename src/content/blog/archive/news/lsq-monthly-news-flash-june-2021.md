It's June, dear readers, and there's so much going on! Stay up-to-date with this convenient list:

Issue 046 has arrived!! With 20 stories by emerging women authors, it's our biggest issue yet! Perfect for summer reading, and with such a gorgeous cover, you'll want to get your hands on a print edition for sure!

Stay tuned for our upcoming submission window--it's for our annual themed issue!

If you like what we do, and want to help us keep doing it, we have a Patreon! For as little as $1 a month, you can support an independent, volunteer-run magazine, get behind-the-scenes looks at our production process, and help pay women authors.

As always, for even more LSQ reading pleasure, we offer our Best of LSQ: The First Five Years anthology. It's packed with all our best stuff, and it's all wrapped up in a beautiful cover by award-winning artist Julie Dillon!
