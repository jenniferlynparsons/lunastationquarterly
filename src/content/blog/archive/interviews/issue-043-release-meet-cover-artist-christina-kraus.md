stupendous women authors, for your reading pleasure. We have print copies for all you collectors out there, as well as digital copies for our on-the-go ebook fiends. And because we love our dear readers so much, we wrapped everything up in the prettiest package with art from Christina Kraus. Please read on to find out more about this amazing artist!

LSQ: Please tell us about the cover image "Resurrection." Is there a story behind this image? What was your thought process while creating this image?

Christina: The painting shows 'Etta', one of my own characters who is on a journey to self-discovery through connecting with nature and the state our planet is in. I did an entire series of drawings with her, some of them you can find on my homepage under my traditional works. It symbolically shows her rising from the blind and ignorant view of the world she had before and now realizes how her daily food choices, for example, impact the planet in a negative way. Knowing this, she now is able to act accordingly and adjust her behavior to a less damaging impact. I wanted to capture the moment she 'awakes' from her slumber of ignorance in a dreamlike aesthetic.

LSQ: Your artwork features vibrant colors and masterful use of light that really bring the scenes to life. How do you find the balance between portraying fantastical scenes while making them feel grounded in the real world?

Christina: I think this mostly comes down to understanding the physics behind light and colors, and how they influence each other. Every artwork I do is based on real world knowledge of the classical drawing and painting fundamentals such as values, color, light, and perspective. You can bring anything to life in a believable way once you master these to a degree.

LSQ: You also share traditional art on your site. Do you have a preference between digital or traditional art? Are there certain subject matters you feel translate better in one form over the other?

Christina: I prefer to draw traditionally in my free time, because it connects me more to the artwork and the medium. For clients and my portfolio I prefer to work digitally. It's easier to make adjustments which could cost days in traditional mediums and it's also faster to process for print.

Most clients in publishing or gaming prefer digital files over physical artwork nowadays. As for certain subjects translating better, I guess it depends on what you are looking for in terms of style. I particularly enjoy my ink work because it's relatively fast to communicate, while a fully painted piece can take me up to 40 hours. This can get very exhausting mentally.

LSQ: Where do you get inspiration for your art?

Christina: From everywhere. From Nature and animals, my friends, my family, from the games I play or books I read. I constantly make mental notes about new ideas during the day! :)

LSQ: Do you have a personal favorite of the projects youâ€™ve worked on? Or one that was memorable due to its challenges? If so, can you tell us a bit about it?

Christina: I personally really enjoy working on Humblewood. It's a pen and paper campaign set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. It takes place in Alderheart, a place where you can play as

birdfolk and other woodland creatures and it's really fun designing them and inventing new monsters with the team. To me, every painting actually is a challenge, because every piece is so different I have to address my skill set differently each time. Currently, I'm focused more on commercial projects than my own to build up my savings, but my plan for the future is to go more into the independent artist direction with the support of followers and fans.
