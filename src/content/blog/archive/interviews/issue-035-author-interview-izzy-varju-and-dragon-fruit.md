Today, meet our Issue 035 author Izzy Varju as she discusses her short story "Dragon Fruit."

LSQ: Let’s talk about the star of the story, the adorable but deadly Mutsu. How did you come up with him?

Izzy: A few years ago I saw a series of digital paintings with fruit-inspired dragons by Alexandra Khitrova (https://www.deviantart.com/gaudibuendia) and absolutely loved the designs for them. A while later, I got bored during a long class and started thinking about what kinds of things tiny dragons could do; cyanide poisoning and having an apple dragon to go with it was what came to mind. The story went through a few iterations, but the main element was always Mutsu and his part to play in the fight. Mutsu's also named after a type of Japanese apple that inspired his pale green scales in the story.

LSQ: This story hints at a rich background. Have you written about Luisella and Knitty’s past adventures? If not, do you plan to?

Izzy: This was the first time I wrote about Luisella and Knitty; starting their narrative when they're already in a relationship was half the fun since it let me get to their dynamic without having to worry about how they got there. But I would like to write about the circumstances of how they first met and how they decided that they would put their pirating lives before their love in the beginning. I suppose that's a common theme in the things I end up writing--the middle comes first and then I get curious about how it all starts and ends from there.

LSQ: Alternatively, do you have plans to continue their story? Will we be meeting the dastardly Zara again?

Izzy: I haven't thought about continuing the story yet, maybe after their past is more fleshed out it would be possible to see what comes next. One thing's for sure--Zara would come back and cause a hell of a lot of trouble for Luisella and Knitty, who will also have a few more tricks up their ruffled sleeves.

LSQ: What is your favorite thing about pirates?

Izzy: My favorite thing about pirates is that they're essentially thieves on water. It's a combination of all the daring escapes and sneaky schemes with the fun of sailing; I mostly just love thieves in any setting.
