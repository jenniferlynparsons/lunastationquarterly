Issue 054 is not your usual issue of LSQ. As our Creative Director Tara Lindsey so succinctly described it, this is beach reading for strange people. I hope that description intrigued you as much as it amused me, because that's a perfect description as possible for this issue.

We are once again lucky enough to have a beautiful piece of art gracing the cover of the issue. This time it’s the work of Indicreates, who shares a bit below about the piece on our cover as well as some insights into her process.

Please tell us about the cover image, “A Kind Face". Is there a story behind this image? What was your thought process while creating this image?

I drew this illustration while going trough hard times, it was a symbol to myself to be kinder with myself. I printed it out so I’d remember it every time I look at it.

I’ve chosen green colors and flowers as both are calming to me.

Take us briefly through your artistic process. How do you create such captivating images?

I like to start with rough sketches, do research, listen to music that fits the art I’m going for and build my paintings from there.

At times I daydream and come up with ideas that way.

When did you realize you wanted to focus on fantasy in your art? Did you start out as a fantasy artist, or have you noticed changes over time? Please tell us a bit about your art journey!

I decided to focus on fantasy art in university, I realized I had most fun painting elves and fantasy worlds and that I have a deep love for worlds that feel different.

My love for fantasy started early, I already dreamed of other worlds as a kid and after many years of trying different things and building my skills I went back to my core in a way.

In my art I try to recreate the feeling of discovering new worlds.

Do you have a personal favorite of the projects you’ve worked on? Or one that was memorable due to its challenges? If so, can you tell us a bit about it?

My personal art that is based on my childhood fantasies mean a lot to me, sadly I don’t have too much time for these pieces but I try my best to paint a bit from that world whenever I can.
