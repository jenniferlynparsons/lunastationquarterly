Ready for the last Issue 043 author interview, dear readers? Here we have a very, ahem, transformative discussion with Avra Margariti, author of "The Lotus Wife."

LSQ: Ah, elemental love! Can you share with us the idea behind the creation of

this story? What were its influences?

Avra: "The Lotus Wife" is a fairy tale, which features elements such as transformation, magical meetings, and characters identified by their attributes rather than having ordinary names. The idea came to me after I read about the life cycle of the lotus flower. What intrigued me the most was how long a lotus can stay underwater before it rises from the river mud in full bloom.

LSQ: As the story progresses, “The blue of the sky was swallowed by a thick veil of smog.” How much of the lotus girl’s and the fisherman’s relationship was determined by the world around them?

Avra: When I was writing my story I didn’t plan to use this particular literary device, but I suppose I did end up using it subconsciously! The weather and the environment reflect my characters’ journeys, and the lotus girl’s health, as she is a being inextricably tied to the natural world.

LSQ: Your story ends in a lovely statement of hope. As the author of the world you created, what do you think the future holds for your characters?

Avra: Sometimes people love each other, but they aren’t ready to be together just yet. I really like the idea of the lotus girl and the fisherman growing up, becoming different people, then meeting again under better circumstances--a second first meeting, perhaps less magical, but no less important than their first one.

LSQ: Anything else you would like to share about your story? Are you working on anything else at the moment?

Avra: Thanks for asking! Currently I’m working on a Young Adult short story. It’s about dissociation, the power to freeze time, and self acceptance. It’s also, at heart, a genderqueer love story.
