Today's interview features Tara Quinn Lindsey, who also happens to be the Creative Director of Luna Station Press, which produced our anthology, though she wasn't at the time she wrote the story that appears in the book. :)

Hi Tara! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

If I tell you about them, they will no longer be secrets.

That notwithstanding, I am a percussionist (34 yrs) &amp; poet (24 yrs) &amp; photographer (10 yrs) who has studied / practiced magick &amp; shamanism my entire adult life.

I am also in my second go-round as a baseball fan, and have a deep and abiding hatred for vinegar in all its forms.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

Roots in the Mist is just the tip of a very large iceberg, the first manifestation of a series of recurring dreams/not dreams I've been having for a number of years. Which is a fancy way of saying there are parallel universes. At least I think there are. I dunno ... go ask a physicist.

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I've put out two things in the last few months. sQuallor // gLamour, a mad, fully illustrated future/zine/thing that was intended as a trailer / lead single for my recent full length collection Invisible Compositions, which just came out last month.

As for new stuff, I am currently editing &amp; doing design work on my next book, Bedtime Stories (For Insouciant Alchemists) which I hope to have out in the cold weather, and am in the early stages of writing the book after that, the title of which I will not tell you.

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I do most of my writing in a space called The Womb. It's essentially a finished attic in my house, a creative / ritual space full of books and computers and musical instruments and toys and a very cozy couch that is too small for me.

When ideas come to me away from The Womb, which is all the time, I am particular to capturing them in Evernote.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

The single most important book in the world to me is Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin. Nothing else is even a close second.

That being said, J.

M. DeMatteis' comics Moonshadow, Brooklyn Dreams &amp; Seekers Into The Mystery were hugely influential, especially spiritually, as was seeing The Dark Crystal as a small child.

I could go on and on, about William Blake, about Miyazaki, about RTD-era Doctor Who, about Buckaroo Banzai &amp; Imajica &amp; the Codex Seraphianus, but I'll stop there.

Oh ... and you should be reading The Wicked + The Divine. EVERYONE should be reading The Wicked + The Divine.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

I should go make sure TaraLindsey.com is updated ...

Thanks Tara! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for Bedtime Stories!
