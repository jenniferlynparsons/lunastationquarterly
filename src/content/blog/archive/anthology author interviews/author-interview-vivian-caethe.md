Vivian Caethe graces us with her talented presence in today's author interview.

Hi Vivian! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

When not writing (and sometimes when I am) I fight crime with my WPM.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

I've always been interested in WWI and the way people would have reacted to an invader on their soil in the "war to end all wars."

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I have been working hard on several novellas and a novel. The novel is called The Squire and is a pastiche of Don Quixote written as science fiction.

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I write in three mediums: handwriting in journals, ivory paper on a typewriter, and a Mac. My desk is usually cluttered with to-do projects, but when it's clean, I write best.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

Don Quixote would be one, of course. But also Dune by Frank Herbert and the Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

I am on Facebook as Vivian Trask, on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/VivianCaethe and at my website www.viviancaethe.com. Drop by, say hi!

Thanks Vivian! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for "The Squire"!

If you're intrigued by the inspiration behind "Folk Songs", consider getting yourself a copy of "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly: The First Five Years" and read it for yourself, along with the other forty-nine awesome stories and gorgeous cover art by Julie Dillon.
