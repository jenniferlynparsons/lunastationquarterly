Today's author is Judith Field, LSQ author and blogger!

Hi Judith! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

I wish I did! When I was a kid I used to be able to sing along with any song even if I hadn't heard it before. "Sing and Song Girl" didn't get called out to deal with villains much.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

Simply that we got a new kitchen floor and marks started appearing on it looking like footprints, that nobody could account for. And I thought, what if something else were living in the house?

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I have a book out called "The Book of Judith" containing 16 of my short stories.

I'm always working on something new, I like to have two ideas in mind, one that I'm working on and one at the vague stage. Recently I started writing Victorian science fiction, it takes quite a lot of research to make the pseudoscience seem plausible

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I write in a corner of our living room but I'm never on my own in the house and I'm finding it harder to concentrate. I've recently started writing in my local library, fine till the exam season comes up and then all the students will fill the place.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

There are books I read over and again, by Betty MacDonald and Barbara Pym, Jasper Fforde and Terry Pratchett.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

Read my stories, I have an Amazon page that lists the ones appearing in print or in e-Zines. Read my blog entries on Luna Station Quarterly, The Pen Across the Pond.

Thanks Judith! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for that Victorian sci-fi!

If you're intrigued by the inspiration behind "The Prototype ", consider getting yourself a copy of "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly: The First Five Years" and read it for yourself, along with the other forty-nine awesome stories and gorgeous cover art by Julie Dillon.
