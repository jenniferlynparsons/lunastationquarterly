Today's featured author is Andrea Mullaney!

First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

Mother of Dragons (okay, dogs), Potentate of Procrastination, radio waffler, daydreamer.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

It's loosely inspired by the ballad of Tam Lin, though the message behind its heroine Janet's fierce clinging to her lover to save him from the Fairy Queen has always worried me ... was he really worth saving? I was also interested in writing about guilt and responsibility.

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I am working on a novel called "The Ghost Marriage", which grew out of a short story of the same name, currently available in Let's Tell This Story Properly: An Anthology of the Commonwealth Short Story Prize (Durndurn Press). It's a gothic-historical novel set in Scotland and Shanghai in 1848.

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I write in irregular spurts, usually in public libraries, writing by hand and then (tediously) having to type it up later.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

Villette by Charlotte Bronte, everything by Jane Austen, Agatha Christie, Diana Wynne Jones, Anne Tyler, Muriel Spark and Charles Dickens; Star Trek, Buffy and 1930s-40s 'Golden Age' Hollywood movies; history books, political activism, libraries, parks and islands.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

Thanks Andrea! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for "The Ghost Marriage"!

If you're intrigued by the inspiration behind "Highgate", consider getting yourself a copy of "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly: The First Five Years" and read it for yourself, along with the other forty-nine awesome stories and gorgeous cover art by Julie Dillon.
