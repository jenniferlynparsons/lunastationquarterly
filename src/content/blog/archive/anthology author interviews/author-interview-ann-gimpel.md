Hi Ann! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

I'm a national bestselling author and also a clinical psychologist, with a Jungian bent and a vagabond at heart. Avocations include mountaineering, skiing, wilderness photography and, of course, writing. A lifelong aficionado of the unusual, I began writing speculative fiction a few years ago. Since then my short fiction has appeared in a number of webzines and anthologies. My longer books run the gamut from urban fantasy to paranormal romance. I've published over 30 books to date, with several more contracted for 2015 and beyond.

A husband, grown children, grandchildren and three wolf hybrids round out my family.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

It's been a few years since I wrote that one. As I recall, it revolves around shades wandering the countryside in a mythical country reminiscent of the UK. Mythology draws me, as does legend. Both are elements of my story in this anthology.

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I have over 30 books out, a combination of small press releases and Indie ones. My newest releases are the first three books of GenTech Rebellion, a science fiction action adventure romance. Winning Glory, Honor Bound, and Claiming Charity feature hard driving CIA agents and the genetically altered women who love them. Except in Charity's case, she falls for one of her own kind, which presents problems of its own.

I’m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I'm eclectic. I write when I can. When I'm in production mode, I turn out a chapter a day (3000-3500 words) plus editing the previous day's chapter. Once I'm done with a first draft, a book gets two rounds of self edits from me, then it's off to my beta readers. Once they're done, it goes to my editor.

My study is upstairs and I look out at an evergreen forest. When I can, I keep the sliding glass doors open to let the outside in. My husband's guitar provides all the music I need.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

I read what I write, so urban fantasy, paranormal romance, and science fiction romance, but I'm not fond of space operas or aliens from other planets. Current authors who've influenced me include Illona Andrews, Nalini Singh, Anne Bishop, Laurell K. Hamilton, Diana Gabaldon, and Sherrilyn Kenyon.
