Amy's story "Magic on the Cliffs of Moher" appeared in our "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly" anthology and today we're sharing getting to know her, and the inspiration for the story.

First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

I'm a writer, part-time photographer, and full-time mother living in Louisville, KY. I'm rather obsessed with stories in all their forms, from magazine editorials to psychological case studies to the traditional short form. Currently, I'm loving polaroids from the 80's and 90's.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

Given my love of photography, I'm often inspired by photographs. This story was inspired by some photographs I found of Ireland, as well as the fantastic illustrations of Quint Buchholz. These combined to give me the mood of my story, which provoked the words in turn.

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I'm currently working on a fantasy novel, but the recent birth of my first child has put my work on that temporarily on hold, though I hope to get back to it soon--successfully mothering and writing in tandem, as many female writers have done before me.

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

My writing set up is nothing fancy: I use Pages on my laptop, usually while on the couch, though I can work anywhere, if I must.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

"Animalia" by Graeme Base; "The Last Unicorn" by Peter S. Beagle; "Till We Have Faces" by C.

S. Lewis; "The Secret History of Fantasy" edited by Peter S. Beagle

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

You can find me at wanderingstorytellers.blogspot.com, and on twitter at @storieswandered.

Thanks Amy! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for your work!
