We're featuring interviews with authors in our anthology. Today's author interview is Nikki Vogel!

Hi Nikki! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

I love to read, write, and play tennis. I hate to say what my super power is because it might make you jealous—I can eat copious amounts of chocolate without making myself ill. Chocolate is both my greatest weakness and greatest strength.

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

"Icarus in the 21st Century" was inspired by two things—my interest in turning the mythology that informs our culture on its head, and by my son who might as well be Sky Boy—that's how high he can jump.

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

Literally moments before completing this interview, I finished my most recent novel—Jack and the J-Beans. It's a science fiction, middle grade, humorous re-imagining of Jack and the Beanstalk.

I’m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I write in our office at home. I have a sit-stand set up because sitting too much kills ya. I've actually had a hamstring injury from sitting too much. The wall in front of my desk has a span five and a half feet by eleven of whiteboard paint where I try to keep myself on track. World building is a bugger. It's surprising how often I forget the very things I made up.

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

I started out reading science fiction. The classics. Asimov. Heinlein. Herbert. Clark. Eventually I branched out and began reading fantasy. Tolkien rocked my world. It was after I read The Trilogy that I though about how great it would be to be able to tell a story that could move someone else so profoundly. My love of reading inspired me to get an undergraduate degree in literature. I have continued to read widely, and from all genres. I just finished the book Boo by Neil Smith. Dude nailed it.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

On my website you can find links to any of my stories published in a digital format, as well as a list of print publications. http://nikki-vogel.branded.me

Thanks Nikki! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for "Jack and the J-Beans"!

If you're intrigued by the inspiration behind "Icarus in the 21st Century", consider getting yourself a copy of "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly: The First Five Years" and read it for yourself, along with the other forty-nine awesome stories and gorgeous cover art by Julie Dillon.
