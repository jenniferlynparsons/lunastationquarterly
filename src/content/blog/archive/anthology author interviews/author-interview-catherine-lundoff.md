Look! It's an interview with today's featured author, Catherine Lundoff!

Hi Catherine! First off, please tell us a bit about yourself. Have any super powers or secret talents?

I am Queen of Managed Chaos? Well, not really, but it feels like it some months!

Can you tell us a bit about what inspired your story in the anthology?

"The Light Fantastic" is a prequel to a novel I've been working on, called "Medusa's Touch." I was thinking about my protagonist's past as a military pilot in an interstellar war and I wanted to work with that. This story wasn't a good fit with the rest of the novel so I'm really glad I found an alternate home for it!

What have you been up to lately? Do you have any books out right now? Are you working on anything new?

I'm going through the final edits on "Medusa's Touch." I'm planning on indie-publishing it through my new venture, Queen of Swords Press, in the next few months. I also just turned in edits on an essay for Queers Destroy Horror, which will be out in October.

Iâ€™m always fascinated by where and how people work. What is your writing setup like? Any tools you enjoy using?

I end up doing a lot if my early drafts on my lap desk, while sitting on the couch. My kitty overlords prefer that I work that way so it can be combined with Snuggle Time. :-)

Most writers are lifelong readers and books tend to be important to them. What books or stories have most influenced your life (genre stories or otherwise)?

Sooo many! I love a bunch of different authors, but I think it's difficult for me to break down between most influential and most enjoyed. I will say that one of my favorite writing-related books is Jeff VanderMeer's "Book Life." Really great reference for writers who are no longer beginners but aren't yet very famous.

Where can we learn more about you and your writing?

My main website can be found at www.catherinelundoff.com. I'm clundoff on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest and Catherineldf on Dreamwidth/LJ. I post pretty regularly on a range of topics for those interested.

Thanks Catherine! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for "Medusa's Touch"!

If you're intrigued by the inspiration behind "The Light Fantastic", consider getting yourself a copy of "The Best of Luna Station Quarterly: The First Five Years" and read it for yourself, along with the other forty-nine awesome stories and gorgeous cover art by Julie Dillon.
