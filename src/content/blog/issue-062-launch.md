heroAltText: "Cover art for Luna Station Quarterly's June 2025 issue by Erika Taguchi. A portrait of a blue-skinned figure with flowing, wind-swept hair that transforms into cosmic elements. Golden orbs of light float within and around the hair like distant stars or planets. The figure has pointed ears and a serene, otherworldly expression, painted against a warm brown background with scattered points of light that suggest a starfield. The artwork combines fantasy portraiture with celestial imagery, rendered in blues, golds, and earth tones."

Hello friends. It's time for our June issue! 

You know, I thought when we put the March issue out that we would be one and done with the extra large issues. I was apparently wrong. 

We received so many amazing stories for this issue. Once again I tried cutting things down to our usual size (12-18 stories) but once again there were just too many to choose from. So, we're going big again.

We've got 21 stories for you this time. You'll find a woman tending invasive weeds instead of vegetables, becoming something wild herself. Two children protecting their hidden magical world in an airport. A mother discovering that lottery luck runs deeper than chance. A lonely woman befriending the monster living beneath her apartment. These stories understand that sometimes the most profound connections happen in the spaces we least expect.

I'm also pleased to share the lovely cover art with you. It's by Erika Taguchi. Read on to learn more about her creative process and inspirations in our interview below.

**Who are your favorite women illustrators, past or present?**

Jody Lee, without question. I actually got into Mercedes Lackey's books because of her cover art. She has this incredible ability to capture both strength and vulnerability in her characters, and the way she handles design and detail is just masterful.

I'm also really inspired by Mary Blair's work at Disney. Her color choices and graphic style on films like Cinderella were so bold and groundbreaking. And Claire Wendling - her line work is absolutely fluid and expressive. She makes character design look effortless.

**What is your dream project? If there were no restrictions on time or money what would you create?**

My dream project is a middle-grade or YA story that mixes fantasy and sci-fi. I'm not sure about the format - could be a graphic novel, illustrated book, or maybe animation.

The story's about overcoming fear and to explore, be curious, and take risks. And honestly, I'm a sucker for romance - Jane Austen is my guilty pleasure - so there'd definitely be some romantic elements too.

With unlimited time and money, I'd love to experiment and let the project find its own form. Maybe start with concept art and see whether it wants to be animated, illustrated, or something else entirely.

Fantasy and sci-fi give you this amazing space to explore real situations through imaginary views. That's exactly the kind of project where I could combine everything I love about visual storytelling.

**Because LSQ is all about stories I have to ask, what are some of your favorite tales?**

I was obsessed with Anne McCaffrey when I was younger - the Dragonriders of Pern series completely hooked me. There's something about that blend of fantasy and science fiction that just worked perfectly for me. The relationship between the dragons and their riders, the world-building, and her approach to combining the magical and technological aspects brought joy to both my inner science geek and fairytale lover.

**What's something you're working on now that you're really excited about?**

See the answer to question #2. Just waiting for unlimited time and money! Right now, I'm focusing on a series of cozy fantasy paintings that feature characters from various fantasy realms, all set in enchanting Parisian-style locations like cafes, bookstores, and markets. I am also working on a line of animal portraits where the animals don Fair Isle-inspired sweaters, reminiscent of Beatrix Potter and the Frog and Toad stories. Oh! I can't believe I forgot to mention Beatrix Potter as one of my favorite women artists!

**Where can people learn more about you and your work?**

My website is erikataguchi.com, where you can find links to my social media accounts. However, I must admit I'm not very good at posting regularly.
