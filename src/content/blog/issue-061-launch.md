Friends, our March 2025 issue is FINALLY here, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you! 

This issue marks the beginning of our 16th year (can you believe we've been at this for 15 YEARS?!), and I decided to celebrate in the most LSQ way possible: by making it absolutely massive.

Here's the thing - when I sat down with our editors' selections, I tried to make the normal cuts. I really did. But in the face of everything happening in our country right now, these stories felt too important, too necessary to leave behind. So I said screw it - let's go BIG.

What you're getting is essentially a double issue packed with 25 incredible stories from women-identified authors. There are bakers and librarians, pilots and baristas. There's magic and speculation, journeys and bargains. And somewhere in these pages, there's hope - which feels especially precious right now.

LSQ was built on hope. I always envisioned Luna Station as an actual space station, a source of light in the darkness where our community could thrive. Fifteen years in, that vision feels more important than ever.

So whether you're a longtime reader or this is your first issue, welcome. We may be separated by miles and pages, but you're part of our community now. Let's be a lifeline for each other through these stories.

This isn't just another issue - it's a milestone. It's a statement. It's a reminder that even in dark times, we keep creating, connecting, and illuminating each other's worlds.

And speaking of illuminating worlds - I'm thrilled to introduce you to Sonia Matas, the brilliant artist behind our stunning cover. Her dreamlike vision perfectly captures the spirit of this special issue. Read on to learn more about her creative process and inspirations in our interview below.

**Tell us a bit about yourself and what got you on the path to being an illustrator. Was there a defining moment that made you decide to make art your career?**

My name is Sonia Matas and I've been drawing my whole life, as most of the artists, but I tried not to make it my job until I discarded all the remaining job options. This was because I was terrified that I would end up hating the drawing if it didn't turn out well. Luckily, it was the best decision and I love my job (maybe too much, sometimes I forgot to rest or sleep!)

**The cover image has got such an ethereal quality to it. What was the inspiration for it?**
Art started being my full-time job back in 2013, and ever since, I've been drawing my muse every year as a tradition, to remember for a moment the happiness of dedicating myself entirely to my biggest passion: art.

**Who are your favorite women illustrators, past or present?**
My biggest inspiration is Marta Nael, Loish, Jenny Frison and Jelena Kevic.

**What is your dream project? If there were no restrictions on time or money what would you create?**
My biggest dream is having a little art studio full of big windows and an orchard. I would come back to painting big oils without any rush and hire someone to design and produce the artbooks that I write and draw.

**Because LSQ is all about stories I have to ask, what are some of your favorite tales?**
I love everything written by Alejandra Pizarnik, she inspires me with each word.

**What's something you're working on now that you're really excited about?**
I'm currently doing a more American style because I'm getting a lot of alternative covers in the USA, and I'm discovering a world of collectors where traditional and original art is highly valued. This month I've been invited to an event by Zenescope Publishing in Austin and I'm very excited to be able to cross borders with my work!

**Where can people learn more about you and your work?**
