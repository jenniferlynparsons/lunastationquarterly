Friends, our March 2025 issue is FINALLY here, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you! 

This issue marks the beginning of our 16th year (can you believe we've been at this for 15 YEARS?!), and I decided to celebrate in the most LSQ way possible: by making it absolutely massive.

Here's the thing - when I sat down with our editors' selections, I tried to make the normal cuts. I really did. But in the face of everything happening in our country right now, these stories felt too important, too necessary to leave behind. So I said screw it - let's go BIG.

What you're getting is essentially a double issue packed with 25 incredible stories from women-identified authors. There are bakers and librarians, pilots and baristas. There's magic and speculation, journeys and bargains. And somewhere in these pages, there's hope - which feels especially precious right now.

LSQ was built on hope. I always envisioned Luna Station as an actual space station, a source of light in the darkness where our community could thrive. Fifteen years in, that vision feels more important than ever.

So whether you're a longtime reader or this is your first issue, welcome. We may be separated by miles and pages, but you're part of our community now. Let's be a lifeline for each other through these stories.

This isn't just another issue - it's a milestone. It's a statement. It's a reminder that even in dark times, we keep creating, connecting, and illuminating each other's worlds.

And speaking of illuminating worlds - I'm thrilled to introduce you to Sonia Matas, the brilliant artist behind our stunning cover. Her dreamlike vision perfectly captures the spirit of this special issue. Read on to learn more about her creative process and inspirations in our interview below.
