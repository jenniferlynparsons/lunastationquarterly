A massive, glowing turquoise forest guardian with a furry body, gentle face, and branch-like antlers looms protectively over a small child in a red coat who stands at its base with a small animal companion. The trees bear geometric patterns and the overall atmosphere is magical and dreamlike."

We've made it to December! It's been quite a year, to say the least. Honestly, I can't imagine a better way to wrap up our 16th year than with this issue, full of aging druid veterinarians, adorable bee-cat hybrids, a vengeful weather forecaster who can control storms, nuclear faerie beetles, living nail art, an unemployed dragon rider and the usual cast of witches, selkies and the like.

Our cover art this issue was created by Sve Yurchenko. Read on to learn more about her creative process and inspirations in our interview below.

**Tell us a bit about yourself and what got you on the path to being an illustrator. Was there a defining moment that made you decide to make art your career?**

My name is Svitlana Yurchenko, I'm a Ukrainian painter based in Kyiv - at least partially since russia invaded my country. I've been drawing little things since childhood after I discovered some old sketches made by my parents. Non of them were artists by the way, but those works inspired me a lot. I don't have a formal art education. In my early twenties I decided to experiment with colours, and that was the moment that set me on the beautiful journey of watercolour.

Before I dedicated most of my time to painting, I was a graphic designer, so art was already part of my career. But at some point I realised I was painting so much that I no longer had time for my job, so I decided to quit and do what I love the most.


**The cover image has got such a powerful quality to it. What was the inspiration for it?**

I think it was the only painting that literally came to me in a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night with this image in my head, I was afraid to loose it, so I quickly sketched it in my little notebook. The other day it became the painting.

Because that wasn't the case where the idea come first, I feel like an observer here too. I feel safe in this scene, even though it’s a little frightening, as you said. I often have this feeling in life - when something looks scary, but the world somehow holds you up. It’s curiosity mixed with carefulness and well-founded trust.

**Who are your favorite women illustrators, past or present?**

I'm in love with the works of Anne Magill - her art is very much about feelings. I hope that one day I’ll reach the point where I can work using only forms and light, without relying on details.

**What is your dream project? If there were no restrictions on time or money what would you create?**

My dream project is simply to return to my normal life as it was before the war, and to be able to paint whenever I want to. For almost four years since the beginning of the Russian invasion, I’ve mostly had time only to evacuate civilians from the frontline and help wounded soldiers.

**Because LSQ is all about stories I have to ask, what are some of your favorite tales?**

I love reading about how the brain works - I find it fascinating. So I love everything by Oliver Sacks.

**Where can people learn more about you and your work?**

I have a website where people can see my works: http://sve-yurchenko.com. There are also links to my social networks there.
