Hello, friends!

I hope September is treating you well. I've got some updates about the inner workings of LSQ for you today.

<h3>First and foremost</h3>

The new issue is out! Go to the site and check it out.

<h3>Submission manager changeover</h3>

As of this submission period, we're now using Duosuma for our submission manager. I'm so glad to have discovered this tool, which will make the end to end experience better for our authors, editors, and myself.

For some context, we've been using a custom submission manager for the last year or so that I cobbled together over a weekend. It worked okay, but there was a lot of admin work that Duosuma will eliminate for us.

<h3>Reprint policy</h3>

For many years we have accepted and published reprints. However, over the last year, we've found that the overall volume and quality of the stories we have been receiving has increased drastically. With more wonderful stories to choose from in each submission period, we've decided to stop accepting reprints.

<h3>Ready to submit your story?</h3>

If you'd like to submit something, we'd love to read it. You can <a href="https://duotrope.com/duosuma/submit/luna-station-quarterly-ehWK6">get started now</a>.

<h3>Wrap up</h3>

Alright, that's all the news for now. I hope the rest of this month treats you well.
