**Tell us a bit about yourself and what got you on the path to being an illustrator.**  
I always knew I wanted to do something in the arts, but the role of illustrator never occurred to me until I was hired to illustrate a book while I was still in college. That was a defining moment when it clicked that this could actually be a career. After that I started to focus my work toward storytelling and fell in love with the field. I studied art and illustration in school and went freelance after I graduated. This year I got an agent for the first time and it's been exciting to connect further into the children's lit publishing world.  
  
**Was there a defining moment that made you decide to make art your career?**  
I wouldn't say there was one defining moment, but lots of little moments of encouragement from family, friends, and strangers who connected with my work. It's the best feeling to hear that your work resonates with someone and I've been fortunate to have so much support. All the collective feedback is what inspired me to pursue illustration as a career and it's what still keeps me going knowing I have people rooting for me.  
  
**The cover image has got such a CHANGE feel. What was the inspiration for it?**  
That piece was done for "The End is Nigh" show at The Light Grey Art Lab in 2021. It was a show based around death and all the various symbolic and cultural representations around the topic. My illustration was made for the "Omen" category. The black cat omen is regarded as a figure with sight into the supernatural, often representing looming misfortune or death in many cultures. The omen appears as a warning that foretells the possibility of death, offering the onlooker insight into their own mortality and the opportunity to change course; shown as footprints retreating. There are various stories of cats who seem to intuitively know when someone is approaching their final hours and stay with them in comfort until they pass. So I wanted to portray this classic omen as a figure with knowledge and sight beyond our own, but acting as a warning rather than an inevitable end.  
  
**Who are your favorite women illustrators, past or present?**  
One past illustrator that comes to mind is Virginia Frances Sterrett. Her work has such an ethereal, timeless quality. Some present illustrator inspirations are Camille André, Amélie Fléchais, and Victo Ngai. It's hard to narrow it down- there's so many I could name.

**What is your dream project? If there were no restrictions on time or money what would you create?**  
Someday I would love to write and illustrate my own book. I'm drawn to projects that have a lot of nature and animal imagery so I would definitely lean heavily into those themes. If I had no time restrictions, I'd love to create a book with intricate scenes in watercolor and lots of tiny details to discover. Ultimately the dream would be to truly focus on the creation process and not have to worry about the financial aspects at all. It would be incredibly liberating!  
  
**Because LSQ is all about stories I have to ask, what are some of your favorite tales?**  
Connecting to art influence, I would say classic fairytales I read as a child. To this day I enjoy reading fables from all cultures to see what visuals are used and how they present life lessons. Animation is one of my favorite mediums to tell a story so I also love Studio Ghibli and classic Disney.
