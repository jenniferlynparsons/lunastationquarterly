It has long been said that the best science fiction &amp; fantasy stories tell us more about ourselves &amp; the world we live in than they do about other worlds, times, or fantastic settings. Never has that been more true than in this latest issue of Luna Station Quarterly.

These are human stories, family stories, and personal meditation, of siblings &amp; lineages, of storytellers &amp; celebrity, and of fish &amp; birds &amp; (man's) best friend, disguised as time travel, vampire, &amp; faerie stories, among others.

So, if you like your escapism mixed with reflection, and are excited to experience the latests work of an impressive slate of female-identified authors, you've come to the right Station.
