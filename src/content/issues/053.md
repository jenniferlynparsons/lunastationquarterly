The promised rebirth of the sun is just over the next hill, and so, like incorruptible nature itself, LSQ returns for another season of scintillating stories by the best up and coming female identified talent in this or any other Spring kissed star system.
After over thirteen years and fifty plus issues, you know what we do by now. Fairy tales and future times bump up against myth and melancholy. Young women and old crones and shapeshifters and the angel of death all walk among these pages.
We hope you’ll walk among them as well.
