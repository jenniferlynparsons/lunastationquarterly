One of the great things about LSQ is that it's often like that proverbial box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Aside from fabulous female-fronted fiction, of course!
This time, alongside unique reimaginings of the classic dragon, vampire and zombie tales (nevermind some genuine ELDRITCH HORROR!), you will find a woman who used to be a bird, a baby with serious time travel chops and much more.
Welcome to Year Twelve of Luna Station Quarterly. Daaaaaamn.
