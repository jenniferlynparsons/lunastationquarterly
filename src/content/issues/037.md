As we begin the TENTH YEAR of Luna Station Quarterly (Holy @#$&amp;!) we are proud to present an incredibly varied slate of female fronted fiction for you to enjoy. From the dystopian to the semi-medieval, from Irish Faerie stories to tales of queer discovery, these stories have a giant, a mermaid, a unicorn, an eccentric aunt and a sinister raccoon, often in the most surprising settings and situations! But most importantly of all, woven throughout the different tones and genre trappings, these are NEW STORIES, showing the bright minds, sharp tongues and large hearts of the women whose aim is nothing less than to reshape the landscape of what is possible in short fiction.
We’re Luna Station. It’s Year Ten. Come on in.
