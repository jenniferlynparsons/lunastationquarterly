For thirteen years and counting, Luna Station Quarterly has shared with you the freshest voices in female fronted fantastic fiction. And this issue is no different, except…
This issue of Wyrd Women Wandering (errrm, I mean LSQ) draws from the best traditions of the macabre and uncanny to give you surprise after dark surprise during the normal lushness of high summer.
In other words, THIS IS BEACH READING FOR STRANGE PEOPLE!
From grandmother’s curses to rat queens, from animal transmutation to hexed vcr’s, with a dash of friendship bracelets &amp; timely AI creepiness, this is not your ancestor’s LSQ. Except for when it is…
Excelsior!
