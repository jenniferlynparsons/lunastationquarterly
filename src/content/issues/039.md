Just as a journey may begin with a single step, the stories in this issue hinge on a single moment. Driven by choice or happenstance, bonding two people together or driving them apart, this lynchpin in time may even occur before the tale begins. We are witnesses to all that is unveiled in the telling.
Regardless of when, where, or how the moment occurs, each of the tales within contains a single instant wrapped in layers of story, leading the characters to places they did not imagine. Come join them on their journey, and see where the power of a single moment can lead you...
