Trees live their lives on a different scale, and we poetically imbue them with traits we examine in ourselves. This does not, by any means, imply that they lack these traits. When our story trees talk or move, express feelings, wrestle with immortality, nurture others, or hold the secrets of life, they may not literally do it in the same ways they do in what we perceive as ‘regular life’—the stories just help us to see ourselves a little better, and imagine the ways that they can. And make no mistake, they can. <em>- from the editorial</em>
