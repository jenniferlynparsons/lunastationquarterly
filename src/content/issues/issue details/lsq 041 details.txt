LSQ issue 041

description:
We’re all different, and in case it hasn’t become clear to you yet, in these waning days of winter (nevermind the world), that’s okay. More than okay, in fact. It’s essential.

Stories of love and loneliness, birth and death, wrapped in both fantasy and sci-fi coatings? It’s all here. Witches and AI? Yep, got ‘em. A scientist, a maker, a young magical baker? C’mon…you know the answer by now.

Here at Luna Station, our differences, our uniqueness, our ability to spotlight stories you won’t find anywhere else, has been our strength since the very beginning.

Thank you for joining us at the beginning of our eleventh year of offering the best in female fronted fiction. These voices are needed now more than ever.
