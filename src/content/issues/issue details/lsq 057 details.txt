LSQ issue 057

description:
If you had told us fifteen years ago, when LSQ was a one-woman operation running on a steady diet of "wouldn't it be cool if", that we would attract authors and stories as good as these, we would have been very pleased indeed!

These stories are deep.They are full of hard earned human emotions, in spite of their fantastical settings. Ghosts and goblins and living houses and fairy tales and the underworld are all great, but if they don't get under your skin, and maybe even draw some blood from time to time, then what's the point, at this late hour?

So please accept our latest invitation to the greatest show in speculative literature, as we all change and evolve and become our next selves, together.

I'm a Canadian illustrator currently living, working and adventuring in Scotland. I work in the TTRPG and book cover space, as well as doing private commissions. I pull inspiration from a deep love of fantasy stories and I strive to instill as much character and narrative into my illustrations as I read in my favourite novels.
Previously I worked in the Toronto games industry as a general artist for six years after graduating from Seneca College's Game Art and Animation program in 2015.
