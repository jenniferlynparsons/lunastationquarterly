Welcome to the largest issue ever of Luna Station Quarterly!

With twenty tales by the best &amp; brightest up &amp; coming female identified writers, there’s enough flavor here to satisfy nearly every storytelling taste.

If magic &amp; goblins &amp; the fae are your thing, come on in! How about dimensional portals, sentient spaceships &amp; poltergeists? Yup, we have those too!

Never mind that it’s Pride Month, and there's more queer ladies in this issue than you can shake a...well, you know.

All of this, plus a dash of social commentary &amp; the stray post apocalyptic wasteland, and you have LSQ at its finest.
