These are stories of opposites, of contradictions. Of transitions and unexpected guests. Most of all, they are stories of courage in the face of uncertainties. We need stories like this.

Yes, there is grief, but there is sanctuary also. Yes, childhood ends, but we don't have to pass into our next incarnation alone. And yes, there is love, and soul, and a lighthouse at the edge of the world. One day, we may meet there.

This is Luna Station. And we're glad you're here. Even if the magpies have started appearing everywhere you go.
