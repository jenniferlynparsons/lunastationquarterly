And thus, we come to the end of another year of stellar storytelling here at Luna Station, as the stories between these covers attest.
We’ve got a little bit of everything this time out. Steampunk, high fantasy, horror, straight up science fiction, and probably a few other things as well, all filtered through our usual lens of subverting genre expectations.
So take a little time to yourself, find some quiet amidst the din of the holidays, and help us celebrate the women in these pages, both authors and characters alike. You’ll emerge changed, but that’s what this time of the year is for.
