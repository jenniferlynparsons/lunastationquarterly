A witch’s brew that gives both life and death, a contraband medicine injected beneath the skin, an acid delivered on the tongue as an unjust punishment, an elixir that transforms lives. Potions and poisons come in many forms, often perceived as one and the same, depending on your point of view.
In this, our second annual themed issue, our authors have put the definition to the test. Within these pages you will find both potions and poisons and we leave it to you, dear reader, to determine which is which.
