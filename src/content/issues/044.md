<p class="p1">We really need the circus right now.</p>
<p class="p1">Why, you might ask? Think for a moment about what the circus provides. Laughter. Wonder. Courage. Beauty. Possibility. Creativity. I could go on, but I think you get my point.</p>
<p class="p1">The circus lifts us up. The circus, like the tarot, could be considered a microcosm of the human experience, from Fool to World. If we would just allow ourselves to be simple enough to receive its gifts.</p>
