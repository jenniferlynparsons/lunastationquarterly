When times are tough, we look to stories. Sometimes our stories do not offer easy answers. Sometimes our stories contain fear and grief and uncertainty and oppression and dark magic and an apocalypse or three. Maybe those stories are what we need when times are tough, when we are scared. They offer us metaphors. They help us with empathy. Maybe, just maybe, they foster hope for better days. At Luna Station, we understand this, and hope very much that this latest batch of Female Fronted Fantastic Fiction does these things for you, as the wheel turns, and we all try to be present, while imagining a kinder future.
