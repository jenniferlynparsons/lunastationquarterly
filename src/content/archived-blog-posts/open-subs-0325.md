Hello, friends!

Hello, friends. I hope you are well and being kind to yourself. Spring is on the way, even if it doesn't feel like it all the time. I've started writing again, which has been a long time coming, and there's a few updates I'd like to share with you all. It's great to connect with you, even if it's from this strange distance between writer and reader. 

First and foremost, the new issue is out! <a href="https://www.lunastationquarterly.com/issues/061/">Go check it out.</a>

<h3>Submissions open</h3>
It's that time again! Our submission window for the September issue opens on March 15th (that's today) and runs through May 15th. If you've been working on a story or have one tucked away in your files, the editors love to read it. As always, we're looking for speculative fiction from women-identified authors, with word counts between 500-7000 words. Full guidelines are available on our website.

<h3>Wrap up</h3>
Sometimes in the rush of deadlines and responsibilities, I'm reminded how important it is to make space for the things that light us up. I hope you're finding those moments. Thank you for being part of this community and supporting the voices we showcase at LSQ.

Until next time, take heart.
