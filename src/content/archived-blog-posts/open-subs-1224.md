Hello, friends!

I hope the holiday season is treating you well kindly.

First and foremost, the new issue is out! <a href="https://www.lunastationquarterly.com/issues/060/">Go check it out.</a>

<h3>Submission manager</h3>

As a reminder, we're now using Duosuma for our submission manager. I'm so glad to have discovered this tool, which has made the end to end experience better for our authors, editors, and myself.

<h3>Ready to submit your story?</h3>

If you'd like to submit something, we'd love to read it. You can <a href="https://duotrope.com/duosuma/submit/luna-station-quarterly-ehWK6">get started now</a>.

<h3>Wrap up</h3>

Alright, that's all the news for now. I hope the rest of this month treats you well.
