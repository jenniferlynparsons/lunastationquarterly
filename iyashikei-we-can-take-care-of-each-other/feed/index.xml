					<description><![CDATA[This is a lovely article, and thank you for listing my post as a source! I love the iyashikei genre and interestingly Howl&#039;s Moving Castle is one of my top comfort reads. Over the next three or four years after writing &quot;Iyashikei and Worlds That Heal&quot; I ended up writing a magical slice-of-life web fiction series called 53 Ganymede. It aims to be meditative and healing without entirely avoiding difficult topics. Shameless self-plug there lol.

I haven&#039;t had a chance to read it, but I frequently stumble on recommendations for a book called The Healer&#039;s Road by S.E. Robertson that is supposed to be a very gently fantasy story. Hoping to pick it up soon.]]></description>
