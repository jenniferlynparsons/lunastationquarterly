					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] GLEO: “It&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;ve just been available where the opportunity has led me. And so in the midst of what the end of the world has felt like, I was painting a large-scale wall, where every day it was an internal mission to find that tranquility that we are all looking for in these times.  On this wall, I wanted to portray ‘good intention’—the opportunity to let our hearts flourish in the midst of pain.” See more of GLEO’s latest projects via her Instagram @gleo_co.
