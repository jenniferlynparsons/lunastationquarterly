					<description><![CDATA[As this relates to Janet Evanovich&#039;s Stephanie Plum series.  Flawed characters are wonderful. Flaws are the meat that make characters interesting.  There reached a point, however, when I stopped enjoying Plum. There was no character growth. Plum&#039;s life was/is static. (Don&#039;t know if this has changed.)  I really thought the first several books were funny, but I guess I expected the author to do more.(My bad.) I loved the books until I didn&#039;t.  I read Frost&#039;s Night Huntress series several years ago and just repurchased them to reread on kindle.]]></description>
