										think about a future where things wouldn’t be saved, our work started to become
										a memorial &#8211; we were becoming scribes of a disappearing world, recording
										things for posterity.</p>
									<p class="p1">It’s funny how your perception of your life’s work changes, depending
										on who you’re doing it for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have
										spent more time leading this rag-tag little kingdom of rural humans than I was a
										research scientist, and many view me as Mother, Chief, Wisdom-Keeper, though to
										me it seems that most don’t listen to the real wisdom I hold.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More than anything, they needed a
										savior, and that’s what I became.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>They are all so young now, and happy, because they don’t know what they
										could have had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I am old, and
										happy for them, all things considered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>But mostly, I am alone, because few know what it was like, and when I
										die, the things I know firsthand will become legends.</p>
									<p class="p1">I’m not sure where the story starts, so I will tell you about one
										place it began.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents were a
										little different: not exactly Luddites, but they did not go in for things like
										phones and the internet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They always
										told me they were tools, but not masters, and they didn’t want me to grow up
										like a zombie, face in my devices all the time.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My God, keeping friends was hard in
										school, because back then, that’s how you kept up with people.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I begged and pleaded, so they let me
										have one eventually, with all sorts of rules for its use.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the day that Mom came into
										my room with the air of ceremony one would expect for a talk about sex, and gave
										me my first Communicator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She
										wouldn’t let me get an implant, but she allowed me a Wearable. She was happy for
										me, but somewhat sad and resigned. My mother told me that they didn’t want to
										make me a pariah, socially isolated, but I think they feared that they had lost
										the battle against society’s vices.</p>
									<p class="p1">After all of my begging and cajoling, I saw something in my mother
										that made the Communicator not matter so much.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may seem silly now, but it was the
										first moment I remember feeling like an adult.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I saw that my mother put aside
										something that mattered to her, even if she felt it was right &#8211; because
										she cared for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, she had
										spent her whole life caring for me, enduring much greater suffering than
										that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had even appreciated her and
										loved her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in that moment, I
										understood sacrifice, and it was the moment my brain and soul tasted what it was
										like to be an adult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I agreed to the
										rules and limits she set with utmost sincerity.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that I was not an adult yet
										eventually led me to break those rules many times, proving my parents right, but
										I accepted the consequences and turned out to be a much better student,
										listener, and thinker than many of my zombified pals.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could’ve been better without the
										damn thing, but then again, I had my fun, so I can’t regret it too much.</p>
									<p class="p1">When I was 24, I tried to marry a boy named Theodore.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was sexually gifted and terribly
										romantic, and I will not apologize, even now, for being a total fool for him
										&#8211; to do so would only perpetuate the idea that one should always be
										sensible and practical in matters of love, and that’s not a world I ever wanted
										to live in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I never wanted to live
										in the world I occupy now, but that’s an entirely different matter.)<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My grandfather used to sing an old
										song, saying, “I don’t care what they say, I won’t stay in a world without
										love,” and I strongly felt that living a scientific life should not overshadow
										the unquantifiable aspects of love and romance.</p>
									<p class="p1">Theodore, however, was not a good choice for a lifetime, and I was
										happy not to marry him in the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>It turns out that the love that saved me was that of my parents and
										friends, who waited with me in my princess wedding dress as the minutes of his
										absence ticked by. Yes, I had a princess wedding dress, the flowers, the
										tablecloths, the hair with jewels and flowers tucked in.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does that surprise you? I was a very
										romantic girl back then!</p>
									<p class="p1">Anyway, Theodore was beautiful and sensitive and passionate, prone to
										great highs and lows, and perhaps not as eager as I was to make a permanent
										alliance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I seemed to ground him and
										thought I was rather a good catch, as I could tolerate his moods, even admire
										them, without getting too upset myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I had my own work, and was self-sufficient emotionally and
										intellectually, so that when my work or his separated us, I was happy enough on
										my own. I didn’t pine for him, but also happy to fall in love all over again
										after a separation of a few weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										knew his every unspoken signal, the change in the wind of his emotions.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So when he still hadn’t arrived a
										half hour prior to the wedding, most people wouldn’t have worried &#8211; anyone
										could have gotten stuck in traffic, or taken too long getting ready; other
										grooms could have spilled coffee on their shirt, or misplaced the ring.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I knew Theodore, and I knew he
										had changed his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mom.” I said,
										and as I sat down, I gently removed the beautiful veil I had chosen, with
										butterflies woven into the lace, and placed it in my lap.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All eyes turned to me in
										astonishment, and my mother asked them to leave the room and fetch my Dad.</p>
									<p class="p1">Looking back on this now, it seems like nothing at all, but back then,
										when we had our ways of doing things, our communities, careers, status &#8211;
										it was quite a big deal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But once it
										happened, my heart was relieved and I knew I would survive the embarrassment and
										rejection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found that a jilted
										bride actually gets quite a lot of sympathy, and Dad simply made an announcement
										while Mom and my girlfriends took me back home and to bed.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Theo called me a week later, he
										expected wrath, but received none.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>That emboldened him to hope for reconciliation, but just as I knew him,
										he knew me:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All I said was, “You’re
										one of my butterflies,” and he understood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>In my grad work, I had devoted myself to cultivating some endangered
										species of butterflies, raising them so that they would be safe from parasites
										and predation, to increase their numbers and genetic diversity of their
										species.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Letting them go meant that
										they would be at risk, but they weren’t meant to be kept.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I always knew it was the right thing
										to let them free.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Theo wasn’t meant
										to be grounded, and I wasn’t meant to be his keeper. <span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never spoke to him again.</p>
									<p class="p1">When I was 30, one of the butterflies I had cultivated went extinct in
										the wild.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My grief was
										unbearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I set off to hike the
										Appalachian Trail for 6 months, to immerse myself in nature and to get away from
										the knowledge that gnawed at me: that perhaps it was all too late.</p>
									<p class="p1">When I was 34, the bee numbers hit a crisis point, and by the time I
										was 40, the angiosperms had begun to fail &#8211; the bees and other pollinators
										had been so reduced in number that there weren’t enough around to help them
										reproduce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One by one, crops, then
										industries, began to fail, and after that followed economies and political
										systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandpa used to have a
										droll saying: “Sometimes in life you’re the windshield, and sometimes you’re the
										bug.” I started to wondered if my lifetime would be one in which I would be a
										witness, or a victim, of civilization failing.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never thought it would be my
										destiny, but I wondered about people who lived at the end of the Roman Empire,
										or who ended their lives in concentration camps in World War II.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They probably never expected their
										lives to go that way, either.</p>
									<p class="p1">I remember that I was out on a field research assignment, about 3
										weeks in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was in a high meadow,
										inventorying whether some native plants had declined in the absence of a
										particular beetle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though it seemed
										that my work had become more of a requiem than anything else these past few
										years, I reveled in the sunshine and the sweet smell of the grasses in the
										wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took me half the day to
										realize that something was different: the distant buzz of delivery drones that
										sometimes flew through the valley below had ceased.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I noticed that I had not
										heard any planes overhead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked
										up and saw no contrails, no glint of sun shining off a silvery fuselage in the
										distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remembered my mother
										telling me about being a young girl on 9/11, having been sent home from school,
										and the strange, sad days that followed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>She said she had never thought much about the flight path over her town,
										taking for granted the constant and invisible presence of jets whining across
										the sky, gleaming in the day and blinking their lights at night &#8211; until
										they weren’t there anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That
										week that the FAA grounded all flights was unprecedented, and in a world turned
										upside down with horror, the absence of the airlines was held by more than one
										person as an unnerving symbol of a changed world &#8211; like the silence of a
										kitchen at midnight when a clock that has always been there stops ticking.</p>
									<p class="p1">That day in the meadow, I was hardly out in the true wilderness
										&#8211; I had a cabin and there was a town down in the valley.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had my A/R connector for work, but
										in those days, going into the field was a respite from the bad news, and I kept
										the connection off most of the time, using it just to log my data.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All those years after I had begged my
										parents to get connected, I had wholeheartedly adopted their ethos.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Staying plugged in, especially with
										an implant, you would get the news whether you wanted it or not, and all you
										would hear was about the riots, or the apple farmers marching; there was the
										beginnings of a pandemic in Asia that had shut down intercontinental travel. The
										blight in the Smokies was being attributed to a die-off of detritivores five
										years previously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without these
										decomposers, plant matter was piling up on the forest floor, simultaneously
										depriving the forest of nutrients while spreading the blight instead of breaking
										it down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rory Musk, son of the famed
										inventor, had unveiled a plan to send out millions of nano-drones as pollinators
										to save the crops, but I knew that it was impossible, and unsustainable &#8211;
										even millions was nothing compared to the biomass of the insects Earth had lost.
										Before entire species started dying off, there were 10 quintillion insects at
										any given time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quintillion!<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that didn’t even include other
										invertebrates, which matters to an entomologist, and should matter to you.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I’ve told you anything of worth,
										please make sure to pass this on: worms, spiders, and millipedes are not, and
										never were, insects!</p>
									<p class="p1">In any case, these are the things that make me quiet sometimes, even
										now. I am sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And back then, I
										could not bear to hear them all the time, so before I went off on that last
										field assignment, I checked in with my mother and father, and confirmed our
										meet-up place in eastern Pennsylvania should disaster strike, as we had taken to
										doing in recent years. I didn’t connect the A/R device until I noticed the
										drones and planes, and by then, it wouldn’t connect anymore.</p>
									<p class="p1">I wish I could tell you the history of what happened, so you’d know,
										but all these long years we only have our own experiences to piece it
										together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know there was a
										pandemic from all of the quarantines, which kept us out of the populated areas,
										and kept us from finding each other for a long time.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even out in the wilds, the smell of
										death came to me on the wind for a month, at least.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure there were natural and
										man-made disasters, as well &#8211; abandoned structures, even whole cities,
										leaking all of their vital fluids, causing fires… maybe there were wars, if
										there was anyone left to fight them, but I couldn’t know.</p>
									<p class="p1">Afterwards, it’s not as if we lived like cave people &#8211; if only
										it were that simple, living off the land like our ancestors.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We still had our knowledge, some of
										our technologies, and modern resources that we adapted as best we could.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I used a manual truck for as long as
										possible, siphoning gas where I found it, as the self-driving and electric cars
										were all off-line. I stayed out of any settlements, even though there was no one
										to man the sawhorses that said, “Stop: Quarantine Area” on the road into
										towns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a way, that was far more
										frightening than the first time I had gone down the mountain.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had made my way to the first town,
										but was stopped before I reached the checkpoint by National Guard pointing
										machine guns at the truck, barking “Turn around!” I tried the empty interstate,
										but the first three exits had concrete barriers across them.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Terrified, I turned around on the
										median and headed back, not knowing when I could next find gas, and decided to
										head back to the cabin, where I holed up for a few weeks.</p>
									<p class="p1">There, the solitude I usually cherished almost drove me mad &#8211;
										the world had fallen apart, and I didn’t know anything about those I loved,
										whether I would survive, or anything at all. I knew I had to try again.</p>
									<p class="p1">My destination was the meet-up point I had decided on with Mom and
										Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I packed up some gear and all
										of my food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time, I tried the
										opposite direction of the town, and came to an abandoned service station.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember, this was a more rural area,
										so most of the people were still using manual gas cars.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The power was off, and there was no
										way to work the pumps, but there were several cars parked, for repairs, I guess,
										so I siphoned enough to fill my tank and put the rest into some old-fashioned
										gas canisters that I found in the shop, and was on my way.</p>
									<p class="p1">I had never really thought about it before, but the activities of
										people invisibly maintained civilization.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>It had only been about 3 weeks, but without cars driving on them, or road
										crews to maintain them, the local roads had a thin covering of debris on them
										already.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recalled a few
										thunderstorms in recent weeks, and the evidence had not been worn away by
										constant traffic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few miles down
										the interstate, a tree had fallen across the right lane.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I saw a snake sunning itself in the
										middle of the warm pavement, and a minor rockslide had redirected a small stream
										to run across the highway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And
										everywhere, leaves and sticks from the last storm had pasted themselves
										sporadically along the highway.</p>
									<p class="p1">Yet all was passable, and I eagerly ate the miles away, each exit
										barred and eerily quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked
										for signs of life in the houses along the way, finding none.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then, ahead, even though I
										couldn’t believe there were no people, I also could not believe that I was
										seeing one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the tiny figure
										of a little girl, pulling a wagon, with a dog by her side. <span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had turned as soon as she heard
										me, and stood staring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the
										first time I met your mama, Chelsea.</p>
									<p class="p1">She doesn’t even remember this, and so I’ve carried the regret my
										whole life &#8211; but when I first saw her, I was afraid.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stopped a hundred feet shy of her,
										and she started towards me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I opened
										the door and called for her to stop, trying to be forceful, but not
										frightening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did, and must have
										told her (very obedient!) dog to sit, as he did so even though his tail would
										not stop wagging.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dear old Charlie…
										he must have been older in dog years than I am now, but had the heart of a
										pup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chelsea and Charlie were peas
										and carrots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like to imagine that
										Charlie was her parent’s baby before she came along. Maybe they called him her
										“brother”; maybe they were a happy family…</p>
									<p class="p1">I did not want to be infected, and I wanted to get to my parents, but
										I also could not leave this child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										remember thinking that she must be frightened; I remember softening my voice,
										and gently called to her that “I don’t think we can come near each other just
										yet, but I want to help you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She
										nodded her head seriously, and I called out questions and instructions to her,
										which she did her best to answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										told her to be brave and set out a plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I set up my tent at the side of the road, and kitted it out with blankets
										and food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I told her that she and
										Charlie could live in the tent, and I would live in the truck, and after a few
										days, we could get together. Then I withdrew the truck about 50 yards back on
										the road.</p>
									<p class="p1">It seemed like a sensible plan, but even as I tell you now, I am so
										ashamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could see her and keep an
										eye on her, but she was so small and so alone.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the first few hours, she kept
										calling to me, statements and questions that grew increasingly
										heartbreaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As darkness came on,
										she called out, “Lucy, I’m scared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Can I just come be with you?”</p>
									<p class="p1">And finally, I said “Yes.”</p>
									<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
									<p class="p1">With Chelsea and Charlie in tow, eventually we came to a bigger town
										with 2 or 3 exits, where you could see the town and several houses off of
										it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s where we found Kyle and
										Evelyn, but mind, they weren’t “Kyle and Evelyn” yet &#8211; they were just the
										last 2 refugees from the town, and after everyone else was dead and quiet, they
										had each made their way to Route 80, hoping to flag down anyone who was
										left.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They wouldn’t have had much in
										common beforehand, including that Evelyn was 12 years older than Kyle, and
										looked even older, having had a couple of kids in her late teens that were
										already grown and gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you know
										as well as any that they became one of the happiest pairs we’ve ever seen.</p>
									<p class="p1">We used to read books about downfalls and post-apocalyptic life, and
										people in those stories were always suspicious of new people and tended to get
										all “Lord of the Flies”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one
										good thing I discovered in my second life was that when we found Others, we were
										so happy, so relieved. It would have surprised me before, but once it actually
										happened, it seemed like there was never any other possible way to behave except
										like when a pet dog sees another pet dog and they run over, bouncing, wagging,
										and sniffing. That happened time and again, which only made me so ashamed of how
										I had treated Chelsea at first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We
										mostly found people in pairs or small groups, so if anyone had ever done the
										same thing with the very first person they found, they never said anything,
										burying it like me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
									<p class="p1">Kyle and Evelyn joined our tribe, and my mission to find my
										parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But over that 100 mile
										ride, we found just a few more, and I couldn’t bring them all, so by the time
										there were eight of us and a dog, we picked a camping spot at the side of the
										road and I set off on my own, promising to return in a few days.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know why I said that at the
										time; Chelsea would be looked after, and if I found my parents, I’d be with my
										people, so to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But we were in
										this together now, so I promised.</p>
									<p class="p1">I drove around the barriers at Aunt Carol’s exit, one of which had
										already half fallen down, and made my way 20 miles to her house.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uncle Gavin’s farm truck blocked the
										driveway longways, and he had laid a piece of plywood against it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clever man that he was, he had
										secured it with a bungee so it wouldn’t fall over, and tied a patio umbrella to
										the truck to protect the sign. I held little details like that to my heart
										&#8211; that at the end of the world, people I loved were still themselves,
										clever, loving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered at what
										point he had attached the umbrella.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Was it when he was the last one left, knowing that the sign had to last?
									</p>
									<p class="p1">The plywood had big spray-painted letters: “STAY AWAY”.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Underneath, written in marker were
										the names of family members and other people they knew.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Aunt Carol’s name, followed by
										“Died” and the date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My cousins,
										their children &#8211;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two of which
										had died in far off places, reported to them before communications cut off.
										Delilah, Brian’s wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He must have
										been the one to tell them, so he was at least alive then, but who knew now? Oh,
										and the baby…the baby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
									<p class="p1">Knowing that they were the meeting place for my family, I soon found
										our names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mother, and the date
										she died.</p>
									<p class="p1">And me. Lucy Caldwell. “Unknown.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
											 </span></p>
									<p class="p1">Underneath the names, “Love to all Caldwells, Martins, and Nagys.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>God Bless.”</p>
									<p class="p1">So now I knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mom was
										gone, and Dad was brokenhearted, or dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>He wasn’t here, and so I thought he probably was dead.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I took a marker and wrote next to
										my name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“ALIVE! Will return again
										until I find you, Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I love you
										more than you can know. Stay safe. Food in truck,” and dated it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was running low, but left some
										canned food in the cab. I felt so selfish keeping my can opener, but I only had
										the one, so I left a hacksaw blade, and headed back to the rest of the tribe.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">After we set up camp on the side of Route 80, and later, right on it
										because the pavement made a very good foundation for some of our endeavors, I
										would return to Aunt Carol’s from time to time.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought I would go back forever,
										but it only took about a year to make it hard to justify. Others in the group
										had their own ghosts to chase, and I could no longer call it “my truck” or “my
										gas”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And each time I went back, it
										got harder and harder &#8211; trees blocking the road, washouts, and eventually,
										the fear that I would be stuck out there alone, stranded.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The message that I had written was
										weathered, and I freshened it and added a new date every visit, but no reply
										ever appeared, and the cans were untouched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I wrote, “If you’re alive, head west on Route 80.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Love you always.”<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know if he were, he would have, but
										sometimes when I get in my quiet moods, I think, “Maybe I should have gone back,
										just one more time.”</p>
									<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
									<p class="p1">All we did in those first few months was try to survive, so when I
										think of my life, it divides into “Before,” “Survival,” and then, “Anil.”<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think maybe I would have just gone
										on Surviving if it hadn’t been for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Our original eight had grown to twelve by the time I had returned from my
										first trip to Aunt Carol’s, and by the time winter set in, we had swelled to
										25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were easy to find, in the
										middle of the interstate; people joined us in dribs and drabs, sometimes on foot
										or bike, two on horseback, and a late few who had watched our lights and fires
										from a distance for weeks, approaching us like feral animals after having been
										alone for so long &#8211; alone and frightened, on the edge of madness.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was two of these ones who didn’t
										make it later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think sometimes
										people survive when it’s a matter of purest instinct to find food and shelter,
										but once those needs are met, the things that are broken inside them are what
										kills them.</p>
									<p class="p1">The winter came, and with it, the trickle of people stopped.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there were any more, perhaps they
										had gathered in other groups where they found each other and formed their own
										tribes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, it would be a
										while until our tribe grew again, and those who had come together formed a
										family of circumstances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The things
										that would have separated us Before stopped mattering, and we just built and
										gathered, and kept each other company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Your Grandpa Anil was one of these, but it took me a little while to
										notice him &#8211; apart from any of the others, I mean.</p>
									<p class="p1">When your grandfather walked into our camp, I was starting to be a
										leader and he was just another refugee &#8211; he fell on his knees and wept as
										we ran out to greet him, and like we did with all of them, we took him into our
										hearts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was only 33 to my 42,
										which would have been out of the question to me Before, when I would have been
										too vain to be with a man who would see me age before him.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But at the time we met, none of that
										was even a question: he was simply a person who had been through hell, and
										reunited with humans who had also been through hell.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All I thought about in those days was
										organizing supply runs and building things to withstand the winter rains and
										thunderstorms, and hope this wasn’t a year with snow. You have to understand
										that it snowed more often back then &#8211; we’d see it every three or four
										years in that area, unlike these days, so I was a bit worried about it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was also busy not noticing that I
										was now Chelsea’s mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could
										call myself a fool, but I wouldn’t be so unkind now to someone else who had been
										through the same.</p>
									<p class="p1">Anil thrived fairly quickly. He was a people person who saw the value
										in everyone, making them laugh at the smallest joys, showing interest in their
										cares.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His deep brown eyes fixed
										themselves on you, listening intently to whatever you had to say as if whatever
										was important to you was important to him, too, if only because he cared about
										you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unlike some of us, he spoke
										freely about his loved ones &#8211; his beloved Opa from Germany, who lived in
										India and met Anil’s grandmother there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Anil hadn’t known her but she was the love of his Opa’s life. There was
										Nani and Dadi, his grandparents from Gujarat; his lively parents, two twin
										brothers who finished each other’s sentences and apparently married two
										different women who were both named Nina; and a radical anarchist of a sister,
										who was last advocating for coastal refugees in the New Miami camps. He had been
										able to learn that all of them were dead, except for his sister, Awni.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She lived and worked in the camps,
										and he had not been able to find her so far away.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hoped she had survived, but held
										no hope of ever knowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I asked him
										about it at the time &#8211; how he could talk about them so openly, how he
										lived with not knowing about her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>“It’s alright,” he said. “I know that our love for each other is real,
										alive or dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knows this, too.
										There is nothing else I can do.”</p>
									<p class="p1">Anil quickly became my right-hand man, ready and able to help me solve
										a problem or organize logistics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										think because I was one of the older survivors, and because I was the original
										Savior With The Truck, everyone seemed to look to me.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I looked to Anil as sort of my
										lieutenant, which he would later on mock me for. While he was falling hopelessly
										in love, I was giving orders and confiding in a buddy.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was too busy for love, excepting
										that the best part of every day was at night, when Chelsea wanted to go to
										bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would not sleep alone, and
										I didn’t know any therapists who could relieve anxieties related with the
										apocalypse anyway, so every night, she nestled snugly against me, and Charlie
										laid against her other side, head stretched out on the pillow.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can still remember the soft thump
										of his tail every time I reached over Chelsea to lay my hand on his silky side.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">Throughout that winter, our tribe helped each other, and when we
										weren’t Surviving, we started to tell our stories.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anil listened as I told him of my
										work, and how most of my career had been a tragedy &#8211; a passion that
										allowed me first-hand knowledge of our impending doom, of watching the web of
										life pull apart and die; the joy of knowing creatures who had taken millions of
										years to evolve, and the pain of seeing the last of them. <span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we started to wonder about the
										rest of the world, and our place in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Once we were safe, the questions started to come: what had happened to
										others, why did we survive &#8211; were we all immune, or were some of us just
										isolated when it happened? There had to be others in the world, right? The
										unspoken question was, Is this the end of people? I suppose the others had
										thought it, but I had answered it in my heart, if not my mind.</p>
									<p class="p1">Having decided that firmly, it was a devastating blow when Astrid and
										Marcus told us all their news.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We
										were in the habit of gathering around the campfire in the evenings, and their
										announcement certainly got everyone’s attention.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them had been keeping
										company for some time, and while it seemed a sweet and good thing that they were
										finding comfort and companionship, I was foolish to not see the next step
										coming. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just assumed everyone was
										thinking about things they way I was. Astrid waited for a quiet moment, and
										then, grabbing Marcus’ hand and shyly focusing her glance on him, announced, “We
										just wanted to share that we are going to have a baby.”</p>
									<p class="p1">Oh, if I could take back my reaction, allow them to enjoy that moment,
										I would, I would. What I really did, amongst the shocked but sincere
										congratulations, was to get up and walk off with one hell of a pissed-off look
										on my face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I brooded for days,
										barking orders, and when Astrid tried to approach me after a few of them, I
										blurted, “What the hell were you thinking?” Thankfully, she just withdrew and
										later, never held it against me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Because she is a gentle soul, and thank goodness for that.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
									<p class="p1">It was Anil who broke through in the end.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had discovered a DroneEats
										warehouse in the industrial section of the town, and were using it as our food
										source, figuring it was safer (and frankly, less disturbing) than looting a
										market or homes where people might be dead inside.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was going on a supply run and Anil
										insisted on coming along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a
										days-long black mood, I was getting so tired of being angry, and sad, and was
										glad to have him along. Anil had become my best friend, my salve.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I needed company, and I knew it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, he ruined it quickly by
										bringing up the baby issue.</p>
									<p class="p1">“So, want to tell me why you are so mad about this baby?”</p>
									<p class="p1">I looked at him like he had three heads.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like he had betrayed me.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could not believe how he could ask
										that &#8211; it was so obvious! But that open-hearted man’s eyes returned no
										aggression, and asked the question honestly.</p>
									<p class="p1">I ranted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Look at what
										humanity has done to the world!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We
										had blown it, not only for ourselves, but for the other life on it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No other animal had had such a
										devastating, irreversible impact.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>All other extinction events in the course of history were natural, not
										the result of greed and carelessness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Maybe we were a virus that gave the Earth a fever, and she killed us off
										to survive! Perhaps we humans were a mistake and we didn’t deserve to
										continue!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But even if we couldn’t
										resist the impulse to replicate ourselves, who would have children in such a
										world?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would become of them?
										Was there no end to how selfish we were?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Even if they survived, maybe in another 2000 years we’d make a comeback
										and just finish what we started!</p>
									<p class="p1">If I tell you I was foaming, that wouldn’t be the half of it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I spewed it out, and spent,
										finally sat against a rock and cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>He came and sat next to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>After a while, he held my hand, and I let him. My anger subsided, and I
										wondered what he was thinking. I dozed against the rock, and he closed his eyes
										and dozed with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The afternoon
										passed.</p>
									<p class="p1">Anil spoke, finally &#8211; carefully. “I know that one of your
										greatest pains is all of the species that will never again exist. Everything
										that evolved, changed, mutated, survived its way through eons; all of the living
										things that depended on them, their own unique beauties. They are gone forever.”
									</p>
									<p class="p1">I nodded; this was a central truth of my life, too terrible, too
										unbelievably huge to be the legacy witnessed in my short span on this planet.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">He continued, “Well, what do you think of everyone you ever loved?
										Everything that made humans a unique species? Aren’t we one more species in
										danger of extinction?”</p>
									<p class="p1">It’s not that I hadn’t thought about that, but there was still the
										question: were we the one species too dangerous? It’s not like I was advocating
										for genocide, but we didn’t have to propagate ourselves, either. Maybe we had
										our chance, and we should know that we botched it and make a graceful exit.
										Before I could respond, he gave me another look, and I paused.</p>
									<p class="p1">“I’ve been doing the math, and figuring that if we have 25 survivors
										in this small part of the world, there are probably hundreds or thousands of
										other little colonies in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>All the people who were on ships when the epidemic hit, the people on
										islands, out in isolation… Tell me, if you put the last male and female Monarch
										butterflies in the world in a jar, would they mate and lay eggs?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“No. They’d need to lay eggs on a milkweed plant. It’s the only food
										the larvae can eat.” I said like a pedant, knowing full well what he meant.</p>
									<p class="p1">Patiently playing my little game, he said, “Ok, how about the last two
										spiders?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“What kind?” I said, just to be difficult.</p>
									<p class="p1">“I don’t know. A wolf spider?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“They’d mate. But then she’d eat the male,” I said truculently.</p>
									<p class="p1">“Forget the wolf spiders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>How about two dogs?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										thought of Charlie and if he was ever lonely for other dogs, and if there still
										were other dogs.</p>
									<p class="p1">“They’d probably mate. But what’s your point? Animals do a lot of
										things humans don’t do, and probably aren’t a good idea to do.”</p>
									<p class="p1">“Why? Because we have a different idea of being in the world?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“Exactly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s what
										makes us human. We have certain moral codes about things…” I trailed off,
										realizing I was walking into a trap of my own making.</p>
									<p class="p1">“So we are more evolved than animals?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“I didn’t say that.”</p>
									<p class="p1">“So animals are better than us?”</p>
									<p class="p1">“I didn’t say that either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I’m just saying we have different ways of looking at things.”</p>
									<p class="p1">“Unique ways of being?”</p>
									<p class="p1">I couldn’t believe I walked into this. But he wasn’t being triumphant
										&#8211; he was serious, sincere.</p>
									<p class="p1">“Look, maybe I am making a point that humans are just another species
										that doesn’t have to go extinct, but what I’m really saying is that doesn’t
										matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What matters is that there
										are going to be hundreds of jars around the world, full of the last few people
										on earth, and you’re not going to keep them from laying more eggs, so to
										speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not even about you,
										really, except regarding what’s going to happen in your own jar.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chelsea will grow up, and if you have
										your way, she’s basically going to be all alone in her old age, with only Alex
										for company whether she likes him or not.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Alex was a twelve year old boy, the only other child in the camp.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hadn’t really thought about that.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">“Or, you can accept that people are going to be drawn to each other
										and have babies, and maybe one day we’ll travel again between our jars, and
										we’ll mix our genetic pools, and humans will survive.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you can either help and love them
										when they do, or try to stop them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										know you think you’re the boss, but you have quite an ego if you think you
										can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No offense,”<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he said, looking away nonchalantly.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">A few moments passed. I thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>The rightness of his words struggled with the truth of my own, and I
										still couldn’t reconcile the gap.</p>
									<p class="p1">But then he said, “It’s not a question of whether we will survive, or
										even deserve to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It simply is.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The question is, do you want to take
										part in living?”</p>
									<p class="p1">That’s how my life went from Survival to After Anil.</p>
									<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
									<p class="p1">It wasn’t long after that that I started to live again.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like all species, we are both fragile
										and resilient, and if we are not killed off, the business of living requires us
										to adapt and move on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had seemed
										impossible once that any of this had ever happened, that the upward trajectory
										of human society could ever stop, but when it had all gone, it seemed as
										ephemeral as tissue paper in the rain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Nations had been built on mere agreements that abstract things like money
										and authority were real, until it all fell apart and the only things that were
										real were food and rain, and the person next to you. While it would always be a
										part of us, it started to seem like that was the dream, and surviving was the
										reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But like I said, we were
										resilient, and we weren’t starting from zero as if we were shipwrecked in ragged
										pants with only coconuts and an inadequate amount of skill at spear
										fishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had access to packaged
										food, items we could salvage, clothing and fuel and the like. Even though there
										were still houses in towns, we built our own crude homes &#8211; it was just too
										likely that each house was occupied by corpses. We no longer had interconnected
										computers, automation, or the systems that ran them, but we could access raw
										materials and had knowledge to use and create things that we needed. It was a
										bit like camping, without the ability to go home if you got tired of it.</p>
									<p class="p1">Stakes were higher when there was no longer an “out,” which focused
										our priorities and what we valued, so that changed us, crystalizing what
										mattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had studied Buddhism and
										other paths when I was younger, and intellectually understood how the prospect
										of mortality was supposed to focus you on the present moment, but without any
										real possibility of death in my Before life, it just never made its way past my
										mind into my heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, we had
										people die when they got sick, for want of medical technology we simply didn’t
										have, and that changed our perspective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>It’s really the only way you young ones have ever lived, and I think it
										has made you happier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are more
										present in your lives than my generation was. I think that me and the ones who
										were left had a great shock and had to go through a lot to become something like
										how you are naturally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to
										learn to live, and so I married your Grandpa pretty soon after that
										conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Astrid and Marcus had
										the first Hope, who you never met, but she was a lovely child and we all loved
										her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And believe it or not, I had
										only the third baby of the new tribe not long after &#8211; me, who had been so
										against it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I certainly did not name
										her Hope: once we started having babies, every teary-eyed parent wanted to name
										every girl child Hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I even
										remember “Hoper” being tossed around for a boy once.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, I chose Rosie, because that
										beautiful little baby brought me such joy, and I wanted her to be named after
										something beautiful. One of the greatest accomplishments of my life was being
										able to find a rosebush and give her a real one.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was 27 years old, and still sweet
										as a child &#8211; I showed her how to dry the flower and keep it preserved, and
										it was her most treasured possession.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>When she died, we buried it with her.</p>
									<p class="p1">You didn’t know Rosie was my natural-born daughter? No, I guess there
										aren’t many who would remember me actually having a baby; all of the rest of our
										children came to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But where I was
										previously trying to socially engineer our society and make sensible decisions,
										once Anil came along, my perspective changed and we just enjoyed life.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We treasured Chelsea and our
										friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Music and books came back
										into the lives of our tribe, and the first spring we all saw together was like
										the first spring that ever was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We
										made love all the time, and hoped something would happen, and it did!<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, not at first.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was older and kept losing babies,
										so it took a while.</p>
									<p class="p1">When Rosie came along, she arrived with Down syndrome.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it would have been something
										that had worried me Before, I did not give a rat’s ass about it, not one bit.
										Anil was the one who had the hardest time with it. It really tested his
										philosophy of letting life happen and not being able to control things, which
										was what he was all about &#8211; what our life was about.</p>
									<p class="p1">When Rosie was born, he could not stop worrying about his baby
										girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He worried about her future,
										about what would become of her as an adult, after we were gone; he worried about
										the health problems that come along with it &#8211; whether she could see, or
										her heart; about whether she would be taken advantage of in her adulthood, how
										we would raise her without the developmental resources from Before. My
										assurances about everything just didn’t seem to reach him, and I realized it was
										my turn to bring him back from the edge, just as he had done for me.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our whole life had been based on that
										one talk, where he convinced me to choose to live.</p>
									<p class="p1">I will tell you something that I hope you will hold gently, for your
										Grandfather’s memory, as it was such a vulnerable thing for him.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems silly now, how everything
										turned out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when I finally
										reached him, I uncovered the real source of his pain. He was being eaten alive
										by guilt. He cried about whether we had made a mistake, and what a hypocrite he
										was, ashamed for even thinking such a thing. It made him question who he was.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">Not everything has an instant moment of healing.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But knowing that I didn’t judge him
										brought us even closer, and every day brought some new joy &#8211; Chelsea
										cheerfully bringing a flower for her baby sister, a first medical crisis come
										and gone, laying her in the grass and getting happy gurgles when we tickled her
										tummy with a catkin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bit by bit, the
										guilt and pain wore off, until none of us really remembered it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I hadn’t thought of that
										crisis in years &#8211; it was replaced by the life we shared with her.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once she was just a little baby, but
										she became a big sister to the many that came later.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And all of those worries? Well, the
										only one that ever came true was that she died too young, but she died in her
										sleep and was never afraid of anything.</p>
									<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
									<p class="p1">The first spring, I taught everyone how to pollinate.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the human race was going to
										survive, we were going to need food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I was astonished at how little my tribe knew about the natural world,
										even though the news had covered all of the natural disasters that had led to
										our current state &#8211;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>how
										climate change had brought about the first Zika pandemic back when I was a girl,
										to sea level rise wiping out coastal cities, the extinction of so many species
										and ecosystems, and the crop crises. Even though these had led to our
										near-extinction, they just did not understand the cause and effect.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I taught them about flowers.</p>
									<p class="p1">Our first garden was in the median of Route 80.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a wide, grassy swath, and made
										a bit of a valley in the center which had managed rain runoff when it was a
										highway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now it made a good water
										source for our little farm, and we planted crops that needed a lot of moisture
										near the bottom, and hardier ones further out. The tricky part was getting crop
										seed &#8211; the DroneEats warehouse basically had only prepared food and
										household goods, so it necessitated our first foray into the town proper.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could tell you more about that, but
										this is a story about flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I
										will tell you that our fears about what we would find in the town were less gory
										than expected; I imagine that once the pandemic hit, most people wanted to be
										home with their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The
										businesses had been boarded up as if in preparation for a hurricane, and we
										avoided the ones with the most aggressive signs, worried that the owners had
										perhaps installed booby-traps inside to thwart looters, before the end stages
										made that irrelevant.</p>
									<p class="p1">Fortunately, the local Feed-and-Seed was one of the not-too-fortified
										ones, and we were able to peel the plywood off and break the lock.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, keep in mind, all of the bad
										stuff had happened in the previous summer, so by that time, they didn’t have a
										stock of garden seed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We really had
										to dig around in the back room to find some leftover stock that hadn’t been sent
										back, but we did find some.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Tomatoes, beans, squash, carrots &#8211; all sorts of wonderful
										things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And tools!<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The seed was over a year old, and
										some of it did not grow, but it was enough to start.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That foray also opened our eyes to
										more resources, so we kept returning and looting other stores for years to come.
										We got medicines, clothing, propane, and quite importantly, canning supplies.
									</p>
									<p class="p1">Then, I showed everyone how to become a pollinator.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wrote it all down for when I’m
										gone, because I worry that in a generation or two, they might not remember the
										hows or the whys, the science behind it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>I told them that many plants evolved in conjunction with insects and
										animals, attracting them with beautiful flowers, scents, and nectar; in
										exchange, these critters would then carry pollen from flower to flower as they
										fed, fertilizing the plants so they could produce seeds, and of course,
										fruit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fruit worked much the
										same way: it provided food for animals, who would then disperse the seed in
										their droppings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, some plants
										had other methods &#8211; corn is pollinated by wind, for example &#8211; but so
										many plants relied on pollinating insects that entire species were dying off,
										just like the insects that they depended on. <span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Existing trees were still there, but
										there was a shortage of young trees to take their places in a generation. Many
										flowering plants, such as the ones we depended on for fruits and vegetables,
										were having a hard time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So when our
										farmed plants started to put forth flowers, we spent just as much time
										delicately transferring pollen between flowers as we did weeding and
										watering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I taught every person to
										see the importance of pollination, so that even when we walked out of the
										village, through fields or woods, or down the town street, we took the time to
										pollinate trees, flowers, anything that needed it.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our children grew up with it as much
										as previous generations learned the sounds that animals make.</p>
									<p class="p1">Today, I continue to teach pollinating to everyone I can, including
										the travelers that make their way to us, and through our own young ones that
										have set out on the networks of old roads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 
										</span>Overgrown but established, they carry news and resources much like the
										trade routes of medieval days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s
										a matter of our own survival, but also a way to help the earth thrive again. I
										know we’ve lost species &#8211; insects, animals, plants &#8211; the forests
										look different today than they did 40 years ago.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there have been times where
										travelers have brought us some plants or seeds that used to grow here, and we
										help them to grow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m always on the
										lookout for insects, and some that I haven’t seen in decades have started to
										show up again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even ash trees have
										made a comeback.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And while it gives
										me hope, it’s not the whole story. The land has changed, and other ecosystems
										have taken the place of older ones. It’s hard to say anymore whether one kind of
										life should displace another. How can you complain about life growing in front
										of you, except that I remember all of the diversity, all of the beauty, and the
										balance, and that what I see now is simply the best nature can do, after humans
										did their worst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
									<p class="p1">Nowadays I spend a good deal of my time teaching science in the
										village. I see children who are happy in their ignorance, because they never
										knew what we had once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve told
										them about the Monarch butterflies and the hemlock trees.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve shown them pictures from the
										books we’ve acquired over the years, animals they’ve never known.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The children are awed by them as if
										they were dragons or unicorns, and they might as well be.</p>
									<p class="p1">I think they sense my sadness as well.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your cousin Mariposa is a devoted
										pollinator, and I think she will be my next apprentice.</p>
									<p class="p1">She said to me once, “Grammy, maybe we can bring them all back!”</p>
									<p class="p1">Inside my heart, I said, “No child, we can’t bring back the ones that
										are gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They took millions of
										years to evolve and interact with each other, building interdependent webs.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ones that are gone, are gone
										forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All that is left is what we
										have left.”</p>
									<p class="p1">But she is only six, and her eyes are full of hope.<span
											class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I said, “Perhaps we can, my love.
										We can try.”</p>
									<p class="p1">I sent her back to her mother’s house, watching her skip happily.</p>
									<p class="p1">And I wept.</p>
