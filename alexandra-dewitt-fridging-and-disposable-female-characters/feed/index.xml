					<description><![CDATA[Nicely summarized. Links to tvtropes for the two modern tropes you mention would be nice. The mannequin incident is arguable, as it&#039;s not a fridging, but rather a deliberate reference to it to mess with the character by triggering his PTSD. While the fridging was sloppy writing, and brutally unnecessary, a villain making use of a past event is standard fare. I notice you didn&#039;t mention Sue Dibny here - will she be in a future Opening the Fridge?]]></description>
