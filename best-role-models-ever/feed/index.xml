Many people act like Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor in the late 70&#039;s through 80&#039;s and even 90&#039;s  were the first seriously kick-ass heroines to burst onto the scene in the realm of film/TV, but this erases those assumptions. It made me think how, just as artists often successivley stand on the shoulders of giants, continuing to blaze a trail started by their forebears, the same is true for women in TV and film. Without Sheena and Lois Lane, would there have even been an Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor? The seeds of greater acceptance for strong women characters started way earlier than most people realize.]]></description>
