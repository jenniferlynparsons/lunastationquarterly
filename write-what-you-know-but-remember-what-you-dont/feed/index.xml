					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re absolutely wrong about this. Anyone should be able to write about anything. Real diversity is diversity of thought. It&#039;s fiction. Sometimes writing other skins colors or other sexualities helps a writer deal with trauma.  No one will ever know what another person goes through, ever. Period. A mother will never know everything their child experiences. A spouse or a partner won&#039;t either. Writing outside of one&#039;s one personal situations can be cathartic and we support THAT kind of writing.
Like you mentioned, you were combing through a writer&#039;s private to prove he was writing about &#039;the right things&#039;. Writing doesn&#039;t have right or wrong. If you censor a writer based on their physical attributes that would be facism. Write anything and everything, even if it&#039;s out of your wheelhouse. Those are the stories that will help bridge the gaps and bring people together.]]></description>
