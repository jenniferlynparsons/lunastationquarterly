					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sad that this well-intentioned essay perpetuates some harmful and hurtful stereotypes about age along the way. Yes, I know you are being humorous about the tiredness and the midday nap. But, please! I&#039;m 66, work full time, and find a good Zumba workout is better than a nap. I think you may be discovering, as I have, that the most exhausting thing about aging is...battling ageism. I have the advantage of seeing that about 90 percent of the &quot;bright young things&quot; who raced past me in my 20s have vanished completely from the (incredibly fickle and easily bored) public eye. Hang in there.]]></description>
