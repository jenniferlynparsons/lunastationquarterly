					<description><![CDATA[In addition to cartoon friend groups with only one black friend for &quot;diversity points&quot;, I feel like it was (and still is) also common for shows/movies with Black leads to have a white best friend to not &quot;alienate&quot; a white audience, like Lottie from Princess and the Frog and Chelsea from That&#039;s So Raven. It&#039;s like they expect white viewers would be unwilling to watch these shows unless there was someone to represent us. And yet shows/movies with an all-white cast are expected to have a universal appeal...? Sigh. But thank you for reminding me how great Proud Family was! And I hope we can expect more animation like Hair Love in the (not so far) future. ?]]></description>
