					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Last summer I wrote about how underrated I felt Suki is in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Fearsome leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, she proved that girls can be tough and soft at the same time. She and the other Warriors leave a lasting impression, with their dramatic white and red makeup, heavy outfits, and unique style of fighting with fans. All of these traditions are modeled after Avatar Kyoshi, their namesake and founder of their home island. Not much is known about her in the show, aside from the fact that she singlehandedly created an island while protecting her home from a tyrant, who then fell to his death, leading people to believe she was a cold-blooded murderer. She also gave the advice to Aang that only justice will bring peace, and that she would have done whatever it took to protect her home. This led to her reputation in the fandom as being a tough as nails, no-nonsense Avatar who would rather aim a flying rock at your head than try to negotiate. [&#8230;]]]></description>
